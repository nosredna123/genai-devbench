Add enrollment relationship between Student and Course entities.

Requirements:
- Create an Enrollment entity to model the many-to-many relationship
- Enrollment fields: id (auto-increment), student_id (foreign key), course_id (foreign key), enrollment_date (date), grade (string, nullable)
- Add API endpoint to enroll a student in a course: POST /enrollments
- Add API endpoint to get all enrollments for a student: GET /students/{id}/enrollments
- Add API endpoint to get all students enrolled in a course: GET /courses/{id}/students
- Add API endpoint to update a grade: PATCH /enrollments/{id}
- Add API endpoint to drop an enrollment: DELETE /enrollments/{id}
- Ensure referential integrity (cannot enroll non-existent student/course)
- Prevent duplicate enrollments (same student cannot enroll in same course twice)
- Database migration should preserve existing Student and Course data
