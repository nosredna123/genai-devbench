# Implementation Progress

## Date: October 22, 2025

## Phase 1: ChatDev Fix - IN PROGRESS

### Changes Applied

#### ✅ Fix #1: _copy_artifacts() Method
**File**: `src/adapters/chatdev_adapter.py`  
**Lines**: 105-165 (replaced)  
**Change**: Copy artifacts to `workspace/` instead of `artifacts/`  

**Key Changes**:
- Changed destination from `artifacts_dir` to `workspace_dir`
- Copy contents directly (not nested project directory)
- Better error logging with file counts
- Aligns with BAeS pattern

**Code Diff**:
```diff
-    # Create artifacts directory in run directory (parent of workspace)
-    run_dir = Path(self.workspace_path).parent
-    artifacts_dir = run_dir / "artifacts"
-    artifacts_dir.mkdir(exist_ok=True)
+    # Copy to workspace directory (where validation expects files)
+    workspace_dir = Path(self.workspace_path)

-        dest_path = artifacts_dir / project_dir.name
-        shutil.copytree(project_dir, dest_path)
+        # Copy contents of project_dir into workspace
+        for item in project_dir.iterdir():
+            dest = workspace_dir / item.name
+            if item.is_file():
+                shutil.copy2(item, dest)
+            elif item.is_dir():
+                if dest.exists():
+                    shutil.rmtree(dest)
+                shutil.copytree(item, dest)
```

#### ⏳ Fix #2: easydict Dependency
**Status**: INVESTIGATING  
**Notes**: 
- Error occurs during ChatDev import/execution
- Likely missing from ChatDev's requirements.txt in the cloned repository
- Need to check if it's installed during framework setup
- May need to add to post-setup script

### Testing Required

1. **Create test experiment**: `test_chatdev_fix`
   - Model: gpt-4o-mini
   - Frameworks: baes, chatdev, ghspec
   - Runs: 2

2. **Expected Results After Fix #1**:
   - ❓ ChatDev may still fail on easydict import
   - ✅ But if it runs, files should appear in workspace/
   - ✅ Validation should find files

3. **Next Steps**:
   - Run test experiment
   - Check if easydict error still occurs
   - If yes, investigate and fix dependency issue
   - Document results

## Phase 2: GHSpec Fix - PENDING

Will start after ChatDev is fully working.

## Phase 3: DRY Refactoring - PENDING

Will extract common patterns after both frameworks work.
