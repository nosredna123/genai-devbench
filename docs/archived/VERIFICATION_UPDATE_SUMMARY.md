# Executive Summary: Verification System Update

**Date**: October 20, 2025  
**Status**: Ready for implementation  
**Priority**: High - Affects all future experiments

## The Problem in One Sentence

Current verification rules incorrectly treat framework efficiency (avoiding unnecessary LLM calls) as incomplete data capture, penalizing smart frameworks like BAeS.

## The Solution in One Sentence

Replace binary "all steps must have tokens" rule with framework-aware verification that treats zero-token steps as an efficiency feature.

## What Changed

### Before (WRONG ❌)
```
Rule: steps_with_tokens MUST equal total_steps
BAeS Run: 3/6 steps with tokens → Status: WARNING ⚠️
Message: "Data stable but incomplete"
Interpretation: Something is broken, data is missing
```

### After (CORRECT ✅)
```
Rule: token_coverage_rate >= framework_minimum
BAeS Run: 3/6 steps with tokens (50%) → Status: VERIFIED ✓
Message: "3/6 used LLM, 3/6 used templates (expected for BAeS)"
Interpretation: Framework is being efficient, minimizing costs
```

## Key Changes

### 1. New Verification Model
- **Before**: Binary check (all-or-nothing)
- **After**: Multi-dimensional (execution + stability + coverage)

### 2. Framework-Specific Thresholds
- **BAeS**: 50% minimum (allows template-based steps)
- **ChatDev**: 90% minimum (expects LLM usage)
- **GHSpec**: 90% minimum (expects LLM usage)

### 3. Enhanced Metrics
- Track execution separately from token usage
- Calculate `token_coverage_rate`
- Show efficiency in analysis reports

## Impact Assessment

### Positive Impacts ✅
1. **Fair comparison**: Frameworks not penalized for efficiency
2. **Cost awareness**: Highlights which frameworks minimize API usage
3. **Better insights**: Separates "did it work?" from "how did it work?"
4. **Future-proof**: Supports frameworks with varying strategies

### Risks & Mitigations ⚠️
1. **Risk**: Breaking existing analysis
   - **Mitigation**: Preserve all original metrics, only add new ones
   
2. **Risk**: Incorrect verification decisions
   - **Mitigation**: Conservative thresholds, manual review of first 10 runs
   
3. **Risk**: Framework misclassification
   - **Mitigation**: Explicit configuration per framework, safe defaults

## Implementation Timeline

| Phase | Description | Time | Risk |
|-------|-------------|------|------|
| 1 | Data model updates | 2-3h | Low |
| 2 | Verification logic | 3-4h | Medium |
| 3 | Configuration support | 2h | Low |
| 4 | Documentation | 1-2h | Low |
| 5 | Migrate existing runs | 1h | Medium |
| 6 | Update analysis/reporting | 2-3h | Low |
| **TOTAL** | | **10-12h** | |

## Immediate Next Steps

1. **Create feature branch**:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/efficient-verification
   ```

2. **Follow the checklist**:
   - See: `docs/VERIFICATION_UPDATE_CHECKLIST.md`
   - Implement phases 1-2 today (foundation)
   - Test with run `23f46f6b-929e-429b-ba74-4b0d20abc1ed`

3. **Validate before merging**:
   - Run full BAeS experiment
   - Verify new verification status works
   - Check no regressions in existing runs

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative ✅
- BAeS runs with 50%+ coverage marked as verified
- No false positives (incorrectly verified)
- No false negatives (incorrectly rejected)

### Qualitative ✅
- Team understands new model
- Documentation is clear
- Analysis reports show efficiency differences

### Key Files to Modify
1. `src/orchestrator/usage_reconciler.py` - Main verification logic
2. `config/experiment.yaml` - Add framework-specific thresholds
3. `docs/VERIFICATION_RULES.md` - Update documentation
4. `src/analysis/report_generator.py` - Show efficiency metrics

## Example: BAeS Run 23f46f6b

### Current State (Wrong)
```json
{
  "verification_status": "warning",
  "message": "⚠️ Data stable but incomplete: only 3/6 steps have tokens",
  "steps_with_tokens": 3,
  "total_steps": 6
}
```

### After Update (Correct)
```json
{
  "verification_status": "verified",
  "message": "✓ All steps completed successfully. 3/6 steps used LLM, 3/6 used templates/rules (expected for baes).",
  "execution": {
    "total_steps": 6,
    "steps_completed": 6,
    "completion_rate": 1.0
  },
  "token_usage": {
    "steps_with_tokens": 3,
    "token_coverage_rate": 0.5
  },
  "verification": {
    "execution_complete": true,
    "data_stable": true,
    "token_coverage_sufficient": true
  }
}
```

## Questions?

### Q: Won't this make ChatDev look worse if it uses more tokens?
**A**: No! We track BOTH total tokens AND efficiency. Reports will show:
- ChatDev: Higher token usage, consistent LLM usage
- BAeS: Lower token usage, smart optimization
- Both approaches are valid, just different strategies

### Q: What if BAeS has a bug and really is missing data?
**A**: The 50% threshold catches severe issues. If only 1/6 steps have tokens, it's still marked as warning.

### Q: Can we adjust thresholds later?
**A**: Yes! Thresholds are in `config/experiment.yaml` and can be changed without code changes.

### Q: What about new frameworks?
**A**: Default is 90% (strict). Add explicit config when framework characteristics are known.

## Approval & Sign-off

- [ ] Technical approach approved
- [ ] Timeline acceptable
- [ ] Risk mitigation sufficient
- [ ] Ready to implement

---

**TL;DR**: Zero-token steps are efficiency, not bugs. Update verification to treat them accordingly. 10-12 hours of work, low risk, high impact.
