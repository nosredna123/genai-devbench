# Archive Directory

This directory contains interim discussion and planning artifacts that were created during the design phase but are now superseded by the final implementation plan.

## Contents

### Clarification Documents
- **clarification-questions.md** - Initial round of clarification questions
- **clarification-questions-round2.md** - Second round questions (first draft)
- **clarification-questions-round2-REVISED.md** - Revised round 2 with best guesses
- **clarification-questions-round2-ANSWERS.md** - Complete answers to all 27 design questions

These documents show the evolution of design decisions through systematic clarification with the researcher.

### Superseded Plans
- **config-set-management.md** - Original standalone config set design
  - **Status:** Merged into FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
  - **Why Archived:** Integrated with Configurable Steps in unified plan

- **implementation-plan.md** - Original configurable steps implementation plan
  - **Status:** Superseded by FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
  - **Why Archived:** Did not include Config Sets integration

## Why These Are Archived

All design decisions from these documents have been:
1. ✅ Validated through clarification rounds
2. ✅ Consolidated into FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md
3. ✅ Integrated into a unified implementation strategy

## What to Read Instead

For implementation, use the active documents:
- **../FINAL-IMPLEMENTATION-PLAN.md** - Master implementation guide
- **../feature-spec.md** - Requirements
- **../research.md** - Design decisions
- **../data-model.md** - Entities
- **../contracts/api-contracts.md** - APIs

## Historical Value

These documents remain valuable for:
- Understanding the design evolution
- Seeing how decisions were validated
- Learning the systematic clarification process
- Future reference for design rationale
