# 🚀 GHSpec Adapter Implementation - Start Here

**Date**: October 15, 2025  
**Status**: Ready to Implement  
**Estimated Time**: 33-45 hours (~3 weeks part-time)

---

## ✅ Organization Complete

All GHSpec documentation has been organized and is ready for implementation.

**Total Files**: 11 files organized into clear structure

---

## 📖 Reading Order (Essential Path)

### 1️⃣ **First Read** (5 minutes)
- 📄 `README.md` - Understand the documentation structure

### 2️⃣ **Context** (20 minutes)
- ⭐ `decision_analysis.md` - Why we chose Enhanced Hybrid approach

### 3️⃣ **Action Plan** (30 minutes to read)
- ⭐ `implementation_plan.md` - Complete 6-phase roadmap

### 4️⃣ **Validation** (Optional, 15 minutes)
- ⭐ `external_ai_report.md` - Independent AI validation

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

```bash
# Navigate to GHSpec documentation
cd docs/ghspec/

# Read the implementation plan
cat implementation_plan.md

# Start Phase 1
# (See implementation_plan.md for detailed checklist)
```

## 📁 What's Where

### Core Documents (Must Read)
- `README.md` - Navigation guide
- `implementation_plan.md` - Your roadmap (370 lines, 6 phases)
- `decision_analysis.md` - Why Enhanced Hybrid (696 lines)
- `external_ai_report.md` - Validation report (254 lines)

### Research (Optional Context)
- `research/fork_analysis.md` - How spec-kit works
- `research/research_prompt.md` - Questions we asked
- `research/copilot_cli_analysis.md` - Why CLI failed

### Archive (Reference Only)
- `archive/external_evaluation.pdf` - Original AI report
- `archive/research_prompt_summary.md` - Deprecated
- `archive/spec-kit_README_reference.md` - Spec-kit docs

## 🔑 Key Decision: Enhanced Hybrid Approach

**What we're building**: GHSpec adapter that:
- ✅ Uses Spec-Kit's bash scripts for project management
- ✅ Makes direct OpenAI API calls with our controlled key
- ✅ Implements task-by-task with file-level context
- ✅ Includes iteration loops (HITL + bugfix) for fair comparison

**Why this approach**:
- Solves all 3 critical requirements (API key, model, tokens)
- Achieves methodological parity with ChatDev/BAEs
- Maintains high fidelity to Spec-Kit workflow
- Feasible in ~35-40 hours
- Independently validated by external AI
