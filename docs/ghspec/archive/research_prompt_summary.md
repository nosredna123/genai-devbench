# Research Prompt Summary - GHSpec Adapter Critical Analysis

**Created**: October 15, 2025  
**Purpose**: Request critical evaluation of proposed GHSpec adapter implementation from external AI expert

---

## What Was Changed

### Original Prompt (Before)

- Asked: "How should we implement this?"

### Updated Prompt (Now)
- **Emphasizes critical evaluation** over solution acceptance
- **Challenges assumptions** explicitly in each section

## Critical Questions Posed

The updated prompt specifically asks the AI to answer:

1. **Is automated spec-kit still "spec-kit"?**
   - Challenges whether automation changes the fundamental nature

2. **Can we defend the comparison scientifically?**
   - Forces consideration of peer review perspective

3. **Template Compatibility Question**:
   - Can markdown templates for interactive agents work as API system prompts?
   - Specific concern: Templates say "Run `{SCRIPT}`" but we're making API calls

4. **Context Preservation Question**:
   - How do we pass state between phases without Copilot's IDE context?

5. **Quality Equivalence Question**:
   - Will single-pass API calls produce comparable quality to iterative Copilot?

6. **Should we pilot test first?**
   - Implement one phase, validate assumptions before full commitment

---

## Detailed Analysis Requirements

### For Hybrid Approach (Option F)

The AI must analyze:

#### A) API Key Control Claim ✅
- **Challenge**: Are there hidden dependencies on Copilot's API?
- **Verify**: Do bash scripts make external API calls?

#### B) Fidelity Claim ✅ "High fidelity"  
- **Challenge**: Does single-pass execution fundamentally change workflow?
- **Verify**: How similar is automated vs. interactive Copilot usage?

#### C) Reproducibility Claim ✅
- **Challenge**: Do scripts have environment dependencies?
- **Verify**: Can we guarantee same output across systems?

#### D) Scientific Validity Claim ✅ "Medium-High"
- **Challenge**: Are we measuring "our automation" not "GHSpec capability"?
- **Verify**: Would results generalize to actual developer usage?

#### E) Implementation Complexity ⚠️ "Medium"
- **Challenge**: What are hidden complexities we're missing?
- **Verify**: Is 34 hours estimate realistic?

#### F) Template Parsing Assumption
- **Challenge**: Can we reliably extract system prompts from markdown?
- **Verify**: Do templates translate cleanly to Chat Completions API?

#### G) Missing Features Analysis
- What Copilot provides that direct API calls don't:
  - IDE context, incremental generation, multi-turn conversation, codebase awareness
- How significant are these for spec-kit workflow?

#### H) Threat to Validity Deep Dive
- If ChatDev uses 50 API calls with iteration and we use 4 single-pass:
  - Are we comparing framework intelligence? (claim)
  - Or execution strategy? (reality)

## Alternative Solutions to Explore

The prompt asks the AI to reconsider:

### Option A: Intercept API Calls (Revisited)
- New question: Could mitmproxy work? More honest than hybrid?

### Option B: Template-Only (Revisited)  
- New question: What do we actually lose vs. Hybrid?

### Enhanced Hybrid
- Add iteration logic (multiple API calls per phase)
- Add context awareness (parse existing files)
- Add streaming (like Copilot does)

### Unexplored Options
- GitHub Copilot API with custom keys
- Claude Code or other controllable agents
- Minimal PoC first (validate assumptions)
- Fork spec-kit to add API integration points

---

## Deliverables Requested

The AI must provide:

### 1. Verdict on Hybrid Approach
- [ ] APPROVE with detailed justification
- [ ] REJECT with specific reasons
- [ ] ENHANCE with specific improvements

### 2. Recommended Solution
- Approach name
- Implementation strategy (step-by-step + code)
- Advantages/disadvantages
- Estimated effort breakdown
- Risk mitigation

### 3. Scientific Framing Guidance
- Exact wording for methodology section
- What we're measuring vs. what we're NOT measuring
- Honest limitations
- Generalizability assessment

### 4. Prompt Strategy (if using templates)
- Template extraction method (regex/parser)
- Context injection approach
- Format conversion details
- Example: template → API call mapping

### 5. Validation Strategy
- Smoke test approach
- Comparison test (our adapter vs. Copilot)
- Quality test metrics

## Success Criteria for AI Response

A successful response will:

1. **Challenge assumptions** - Not accept claims at face value
2. **Provide evidence** - Use specific examples from templates/scripts
3. **Propose alternatives** - If flaws found, suggest better solutions
4. **Show implementation** - Code examples, not just concepts
5. **Assess validity** - Honest evaluation of scientific defensibility
6. **Estimate effort** - Realistic time/complexity assessment
7. **Identify risks** - What could go wrong, how to mitigate

## How to Use This Prompt

### Step 1: Send to External AI
- Copy `docs/ghspec_research_prompt.md` in full
- Use with Claude, GPT-4, or other capable AI
- Request ~2000 word detailed analysis

### Step 2: Review Response
- Check if AI challenged assumptions (or just agreed)
- Verify proposed solutions have implementation details
- Assess if scientific framing is honest and defensible

### Step 3: Decision Point
- If AI validates Hybrid: Proceed with implementation
- If AI proposes alternative: Evaluate pros/cons carefully
- If AI identifies fatal flaws: Reconsider entire approach

### Step 4: Document Decision
- Update `ghspec_adapter.py` with chosen approach
- Document rationale in code comments
- Update research documents with final strategy

## Key Differences from Original

| Aspect | Original Prompt | Updated Prompt |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Tone | "Help us implement this" | "Critically evaluate this" |
| Focus | Solution details | Solution validation |
| Depth | Problem description | Problem + proposed solution + critique framework |
| Output | Implementation plan | Verdict + alternative + implementation |
| Evidence | Conceptual | Concrete (actual templates, scripts, code) |
| Openness | Somewhat open | Explicitly requests alternatives |

---

## Expected Outcome

After external AI analysis, we should have:

✅ **Validated approach** - Either Hybrid or better alternative  
✅ **Implementation plan** - Detailed, realistic, with code examples  
✅ **Scientific framing** - Honest methodology section for paper  
✅ **Risk mitigation** - Known challenges and how to address them  
✅ **Confidence** - Peer-review-ready justification for our choice  

This enables informed decision-making before committing significant implementation effort.
