# Run Count Information Enhancement

**Date:** October 17, 2025  
**Commit:** `3015912`  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Enhanced the statistical report generation to include explicit run count information throughout multiple sections, improving transparency and helping readers understand the statistical power and reliability of the analysis.

## Motivation

While the statistical report provided comprehensive analysis, the sample size information (number of runs per framework) was not prominently displayed. This made it difficult for readers to:

1. Quickly understand how many experiments were conducted
2. Properly interpret confidence interval widths
3. Assess statistical power of the tests
4. Understand why certain results are preliminary

## Implementation

### Changes Made

#### 1. **Report Header Enhancement**

Added a "Sample Size" line to the report header:

```markdown
**Sample Size:** 48 total runs (baes: 17, chatdev: 16, ghspec: 15)
```

**Location:** `src/analysis/statistics.py` lines 767-783

**Implementation:**
- Calculate `run_counts` dict from `frameworks_data`
- Compute `total_runs` and format `run_counts_str`
- Add to header section

#### 2. **New Subsection: Sample Size and Replication**

Added comprehensive subsection under "Experimental Protocol" explaining:

- Total number of runs and breakdown per framework
- Replication protocol details
- Independence of runs
- Sources of variance
- Statistical implications

**Location:** `src/analysis/statistics.py` lines 830-866

**Content Structure:**
```markdown
#### **Sample Size and Replication**

This analysis is based on **48 experimental runs** across three frameworks:
- **baes**: 17 independent runs
- **chatdev**: 16 independent runs
- **ghspec**: 15 independent runs

**Replication Protocol:**
- [Details about run independence and methodology]

**Statistical Implications:**
- [Explains variance sources and CI interpretation]
```

#### 3. **Executive Summary Context**

Added sample size information at the top of the Executive Summary:

```markdown
*Based on 48 runs across 3 frameworks: baes (n=17), chatdev (n=16), ghspec (n=15)*
```

**Location:** `src/analysis/statistics.py` lines 590-596

**Changes:**
- Updated `_generate_executive_summary()` signature to accept `run_counts` parameter
- Added sample size context line
- Updated function call to pass `run_counts`

#### 4. **Aggregate Statistics Table - N Column**

Added "N" column to the main aggregate statistics table showing runs per framework:

```markdown
| Framework | N | AEI | API_CALLS | ... |
|-----------|---|-----|-----------|-----|
| baes      | 17| ... | ...       | ... |
| chatdev   | 16| ... | ...       | ... |
| ghspec    | 15| ... | ...       | ... |
```

**Location:** `src/analysis/statistics.py` lines 1107-1134

**Changes:**
- Modified table header to include "N" column
- Updated separator to match new column
- Modified row generation to include `run_counts[framework]`

#### 5. **Small Sample Awareness - Actual Counts**

Updated the "Small Sample Awareness" bullet point in Conclusion Validity:

**Before:**
```markdown
- **Small Sample Awareness**: Current results (5 runs) show large CI widths...
```

**After:**
```markdown
- **Small Sample Awareness**: Current results (baes: 17, chatdev: 16, ghspec: 15) show large CI widths...
```

**Location:** `src/analysis/statistics.py` line 976

## Sample Sizes

Current experimental runs:
- **baes**: 17 runs
- **chatdev**: 16 runs  
- **ghspec**: 15 runs
- **Total**: 48 runs

These are the actual counts from `runs/runs_manifest.json` at the time of this enhancement.

## Impact

### Improved Transparency

1. **Immediate visibility**: Sample sizes now visible in report header
2. **Context for interpretation**: Readers understand why CIs are wide
3. **Statistical literacy**: Better understanding of preliminary nature of results
4. **Reproducibility**: Clear documentation of replication protocol

### Better Statistical Communication

1. **CI interpretation**: Readers know sample sizes when evaluating confidence intervals
2. **Power awareness**: Explicit acknowledgment that results are preliminary
3. **Stopping rule context**: Clear explanation of experimental progression
4. **Non-significance understanding**: Better context for interpreting p > 0.05 results

### Report Quality

1. **Professional presentation**: Standard practice to report sample sizes
2. **Academic rigor**: Meets expectations for experimental research reporting
3. **User-friendly**: Multiple touchpoints ensure readers don't miss this information
4. **Comprehensive**: Sample sizes appear in every major section

## Verification

### Generated Report Sections

All sections now include run count information:

1. ✅ **Header**: Shows "48 total runs (baes: 17, chatdev: 16, ghspec: 15)"
2. ✅ **Experimental Protocol**: Detailed subsection with replication details
3. ✅ **Executive Summary**: Sample size context at top
4. ✅ **Aggregate Statistics**: "N" column in main table
5. ✅ **Conclusion Validity**: Actual counts in Small Sample Awareness

### Testing

Report generation tested successfully:
```bash
./runners/analyze_results.sh
```

Output:
- ✅ No syntax errors
- ✅ All sections generated correctly
- ✅ Run counts accurate (verified against manifest)
- ✅ Formatting consistent throughout

## Files Modified

### Source Code
- `src/analysis/statistics.py`:
  - Added `run_counts` calculation (line 767)
  - Enhanced header (lines 767-783)

  - Updated `_generate_executive_summary()` signature (line 579)
  - Added Executive Summary context (lines 590-596)
  - Modified aggregate table header and rows (lines 1107-1134)
  - Updated Small Sample Awareness (line 976)

### Generated Output

## Related Work

This enhancement complements previous Phase 1 improvements:

1. **Phase 1** (commits `6276360` and `ecbaa47`):
   - Fixed misleading quality metrics reporting
   - Added status column to metrics
   - Improved data quality alerts

2. **This Enhancement** (commit `3015912`):
   - Added run count transparency
   - Improved statistical context
   - Enhanced report understandability

Together, these changes significantly improve the statistical report's quality, transparency, and usefulness for readers interpreting experimental results.

## Next Steps

### Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Dynamic Updates**: As more runs are added, all counts automatically update
2. **Power Analysis**: Could add section showing statistical power for current sample sizes
3. **Stopping Rule Visualization**: Could show progress toward CI half-width threshold
4. **Sample Size Recommendations**: Per-metric suggestions for target sample sizes

### Current Status

- ✅ **Implementation Complete**: All planned changes implemented
- ✅ **Testing Verified**: Report generation successful
- ✅ **Committed**: Changes committed with descriptive message
- ✅ **Documented**: This document provides comprehensive record

## Conclusion

The enhancement successfully adds run count information throughout the statistical report, making sample sizes explicit and helping readers properly interpret the experimental results. This is a standard best practice in statistical reporting and significantly improves the report's transparency and professional quality.

The changes are minimal, focused, and maintain backward compatibility - the report structure and other sections remain unchanged. All modifications follow the existing code style and patterns in `statistics.py`.
