## ‚ùå UNSUPPORTED CLAIMS - Do Not Make These

### Autonomy Claims for BAEs

**‚ùå Do NOT claim:**
- "BAEs achieves perfect autonomy" ‚ùå
- "BAEs operates without human intervention" ‚ùå
- "All three frameworks are equally autonomous" ‚ùå
- "BAEs has AUTR=1.0" (as a verified measurement) ‚ùå

**Why:** BAEs has no HITL detection mechanism. The value AUTR=1.0 is hardcoded, not measured.

**‚úÖ Alternative phrasing:**
- "BAEs autonomy was not measured in this experiment"
- "BAEs did not implement HITL detection"
- "Manual log review suggests BAEs operated autonomously, but this was not instrumentally verified"

### Efficiency Index Comparisons with BAEs

**‚ùå Do NOT claim:**
- "BAEs has the best efficiency index (AEI=0.095)" ‚ùå
- "BAEs balances autonomy and efficiency better than competitors" ‚ùå
- "AEI comparison across all three frameworks shows..." ‚ùå

**Why:** AEI depends on AUTR, which is unreliable for BAEs.

**‚úÖ Alternative phrasing:**
- "Efficiency index not comparable across frameworks due to measurement inconsistency"
- "Token efficiency (not AEI) shows BAEs uses fewer resources"

### Quality Metrics

**‚ùå Do NOT claim:**
- "All frameworks produced working applications" ‚ùå
- "Code quality is comparable" ‚ùå
- "CRUD operations were successfully implemented" ‚ùå

**Why:** Applications were not executed. Q*, ESR, CRUDe, MC all zero (not measured).

**‚úÖ Alternative phrasing:**
- "This experiment measured code generation efficiency, not runtime quality"
- "Quality metrics require application execution (not performed)"

## üìù RECOMMENDED ABSTRACT/CONCLUSION LANGUAGE

### Good Example (Honest and Accurate)

> "We compared three autonomous AI software development frameworks (BAEs, ChatDev, GHSpec) on token efficiency, execution speed, and API usage. Results show BAEs consumes 9.6x fewer tokens and executes 9.1x faster than ChatDev, with statistically significant differences (p < 0.0001). ChatDev demonstrates superior prompt caching efficiency (13.7% hit rate vs ~2% for others). ChatDev and GHSpec both achieved verified autonomy (AUTR=1.0) through active HITL detection. BAEs autonomy was not measured due to missing detection instrumentation. These findings suggest architectural differences significantly impact resource consumption, with BAEs' kernel-mediated approach showing substantial efficiency gains in token usage and execution time."

### Bad Example (Overreaching)

> ‚ùå "We demonstrate that BAEs achieves superior performance across all metrics, including perfect autonomy (AUTR=1.0) while consuming 90% fewer tokens than ChatDev. All three frameworks operated without human intervention, proving their capability for fully autonomous software development."

**Problems:**
- Claims "all metrics" (false - quality not measured)
- Claims BAEs autonomy (not measured)
- Claims "all three frameworks" autonomous (only 2 verified)
- Implies causation without evidence

## üéì CONTRIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE

**What This Research Actually Shows (Honestly):**

1. **Architectural efficiency varies greatly** - Kernel mediation (BAEs) vs. multi-agent collaboration (ChatDev) vs. sequential specification (GHSpec) have different resource profiles

2. **Measurement methodology matters** - You cannot compare autonomy without consistent detection mechanisms

3. **Cost/speed trade-offs exist** - Faster frameworks use fewer tokens (BAEs), but multi-agent approaches enable better caching (ChatDev)

4. **Standardization needed** - The field needs agreed-upon measurement protocols for autonomous framework evaluation

**This is valuable research** - not despite the limitations, but because you honestly identified them. That's how science advances.
