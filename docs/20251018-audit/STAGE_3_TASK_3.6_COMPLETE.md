# Stage 3 Task 3.6: Cost Analysis Section - COMPLETE ‚úÖ

**Date:** October 19, 2025  
**Task:** Generate cost analysis section if cost_analysis.enabled flag is true  
**Status:** ‚úÖ Complete  
**Test Results:** 169/169 unit tests passing (100%)

---

## Overview

Implemented a new optional cost analysis section in the statistical report that provides detailed USD cost breakdowns, cache savings analysis, and cost distribution metrics. This section is disabled by default but can be enabled via config to provide transparency about API costs.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration Addition (`config/experiment.yaml`)

Added new cost_analysis section to report configuration (order 8, between relative_performance and kruskal_wallis):

```yaml
- name: cost_analysis
  enabled: false                    # Disabled by default (opt-in)
  order: 8
  title: "Cost Analysis"
  description: "Detailed USD cost breakdown with cache savings"
  show_breakdown: true              # Show cost components (input/cached/output)
  show_per_run: true                # Show individual run costs
  show_cache_efficiency: true       # Show cache hit rates and savings
```

**Design Decision: Disabled by Default**
- Cost data may not always be available (older runs, missing pricing)
- Keeps default reports focused on performance metrics
- Users can opt-in when cost is a key concern
- Avoids report clutter for academic/research contexts

### 2. Helper Function (`src/analysis/report_generator.py`)

Added `_generate_cost_analysis()` function (~215 lines):

```python
def _generate_cost_analysis(
    frameworks_data: Dict[str, List[Dict[str, float]]],
    config: Dict[str, Any]
) -> List[str]:
    """
    Generate cost analysis section with USD breakdown and cache savings.
    
    Generates up to 4 subsections based on config flags:
    1. Total Cost Comparison (always included)
    2. Cost Breakdown by Component (if show_breakdown=true)
    3. Cache Efficiency (if show_cache_efficiency=true)  
    4. Cost Distribution by Run (if show_per_run=true)
    """
```

**Key Features:**
- ‚úÖ Graceful degradation if COST_USD data missing
- ‚úÖ Uses CostCalculator to recompute breakdowns from token counts
- ‚úÖ Configurable subsections via flags
- ‚úÖ Robust error handling (logs warnings, doesn't crash)
- ‚úÖ Clear explanatory text for each table

### 3. Integration into Report Generator

Added section generation call after relative_performance section:

```python
# Cost Analysis Section (Config-driven, optional)
cost_config = metrics_config.get_report_section('cost_analysis')
if cost_config and cost_config.get('enabled', False):
    logger.info("Generating cost analysis section")
    # Pass the full config dict to access model pricing
    cost_config_with_model = {**cost_config, 'model': config.get('model', 'gpt-4o-mini')}
    cost_lines = _generate_cost_analysis(frameworks_data, cost_config_with_model)
    lines.extend(cost_lines)
else:
    logger.info("Cost analysis section disabled by config")
```

**Pattern:**
- Checks if section enabled (default: false)
- Passes model name for CostCalculator initialization
- Logs whether section is generated or skipped
- Integrates seamlessly with other config-driven sections

### 4. Section Ordering Update

Updated order numbers for sections after cost_analysis:
- cost_analysis: order 8 (new)
- kruskal_wallis: order 9 (was 8)
- pairwise_comparisons: order 10 (was 9)
- outlier_detection: order 11 (was 10)
- visual_summary: order 12 (was 11)
- recommendations: order 13 (was 12)
- limitations: order 14 (was 13)

## Generated Output

### Subsection 1: Total Cost Comparison (Always Shown)

```markdown
### üí∞ Total Cost Comparison

| Framework | Total Cost | Mean/Run | Min | Max | Runs |
|-----------|------------|----------|-----|-----|------|
| BAEs      | $0.1234    | $0.0247  | $0.0200 | $0.0280 | 5    |
| ChatDev   | $0.0987    | $0.0197  | $0.0180 | $0.0220 | 5    |
| GHSpec    | $0.1456    | $0.0291  | $0.0250 | $0.0310 | 5    |
```

**What it shows:**
- Total cost across all runs per framework
- Mean cost per run (for budgeting)
- Min/max to show variability
- Run count for context

### Subsection 2: Cost Breakdown by Component (if enabled)

```markdown
### üìä Cost Breakdown by Component

Breaking down costs into input (uncached), cached input, and output tokens.

| Framework | Input (Uncached) | Input (Cached) | Output | Total |
|-----------|------------------|----------------|--------|-------|
| BAEs      | $0.0500          | $0.0234       | $0.0500 | $0.1234 |
| ChatDev   | $0.0400          | $0.0187       | $0.0400 | $0.0987 |
| GHSpec    | $0.0600          | $0.0256       | $0.0600 | $0.1456 |
```

**What it shows:**
- Where costs come from (input vs output)
- How much cache is saving (cached input at 50% discount)
- Component costs for optimization insights

**Implementation Note:**
- Recalculates from TOK_IN, TOK_OUT, CACHED_TOKENS using CostCalculator
- Uses model pricing from config
- Falls back gracefully if token data missing

### Subsection 3: Cache Efficiency (if enabled)

```markdown
### üéØ Cache Efficiency

Savings from OpenAI's prompt caching (50% discount on cached tokens).

| Framework | Cache Hit Rate | Tokens Cached | Savings | Effective Discount |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|---------|-------------------|
| BAEs      | 47.2%          | 120,000      | $0.0234 | 15.9% |
| ChatDev   | 41.5%          | 95,000       | $0.0187 | 15.9% |
| GHSpec    | 38.8%          | 110,000      | $0.0256 | 14.9% |
```

**What it shows:**
- **Cache Hit Rate:** % of input tokens served from cache
- **Tokens Cached:** Total cached tokens across runs
- **Savings:** USD saved by caching (vs full price)
- **Effective Discount:** Overall cost reduction from cache

**Formulas:**
```python
cache_hit_rate = (total_cached / total_input) * 100
savings = cached_tokens * (input_price - cached_price) / 1M
effective_discount = savings / (total_cost + savings) * 100
```

**Insights:**
- Identifies which frameworks benefit most from caching
- Shows real cost impact of cache (not just token counts)
- Effective discount normalizes across frameworks

### Subsection 4: Cost Distribution by Run (if enabled)

```markdown
### üìà Cost Distribution by Run

Individual run costs show variability and help identify outliers.

**BAEs:** 
  $0.0247, $0.0253, $0.0240, $0.0280, $0.0214

**ChatDev:** 
  $0.0197, $0.0205, $0.0190, $0.0220, $0.0175

**GHSpec:** 
  $0.0291, $0.0305, $0.0280, $0.0310, $0.0270
```

**What it shows:**
- Individual run costs for transparency
- Variability within each framework
- Potential outliers (unusually high/low costs)

**Use Cases:**
- Identify anomalous runs
- Understand cost predictability
- Debug cost spikes

---

## Data Requirements

### Required Metrics

The cost analysis section requires these metrics in `frameworks_data`:

1. **COST_USD** (primary)
   - Total USD cost per run
   - Calculated by metrics collector using CostCalculator
   - Must be present in run dictionaries

2. **TOK_IN** (for breakdown and cache efficiency)
   - Total input tokens
   - Used to recalculate cost components

3. **TOK_OUT** (for breakdown)
   - Total output tokens
   - Used to recalculate cost components

4. **CACHED_TOKENS** (for cache efficiency)
   - Cached input tokens
   - Used to calculate cache savings

### Graceful Degradation

**If COST_USD missing:**
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è **Cost data not available**

Cost metrics (COST_USD) were not calculated for this experiment.
This may occur if:
- Runs were executed before cost tracking was implemented
- Cost calculation failed during metrics collection
- Model pricing information was unavailable

To enable cost tracking, ensure:
1. Model pricing is defined in `config/experiment.yaml` under `pricing.models`
2. Metrics collector has access to token counts (TOK_IN, TOK_OUT, CACHED_TOKENS)
3. Cost calculator is properly initialized in the adapter
```

**If breakdown fails:**
```markdown
‚ö†Ô∏è Cost breakdown unavailable (pricing data or token counts missing)
```

**If cache data missing:**
```markdown
No cache data available for this experiment.
```

This ensures reports are still generated even with incomplete cost data.

- Where are costs coming from? (input vs output)
- Is caching working well?

### 4. Budget Planning
Supports financial planning:
- Mean cost/run for extrapolation
- Min/max for risk assessment
- Total costs for actual spend

### 5. Optional Feature
Doesn't clutter reports when not needed:
- Disabled by default (enabled: false)
- Academic users can ignore costs
- Commercial users can enable when relevant

## Usage Examples

### Example 1: Enable Cost Analysis (Basic)

```yaml
# config/experiment.yaml
report:
  sections:
    - name: cost_analysis
      enabled: true  # Just enable, use all defaults
```

**Result:** All four subsections generated with default settings.

### Example 2: Cost Summary Only

```yaml
# config/experiment.yaml
report:
  sections:
    - name: cost_analysis
      enabled: true
      show_breakdown: false      # Skip component breakdown
      show_per_run: false         # Skip individual costs
      show_cache_efficiency: false  # Skip cache analysis
```

**Result:** Only total cost comparison table shown.

### Example 3: Cache Analysis Focus

```yaml
# config/experiment.yaml
report:
  sections:
    - name: cost_analysis
      enabled: true
      title: "Cache Performance & Cost Savings"
      show_breakdown: false
      show_per_run: false
      show_cache_efficiency: true  # Focus on cache ROI
```

**Result:** Total costs + detailed cache efficiency analysis.

### Example 4: Custom Title

```yaml
# config/experiment.yaml
report:
  sections:
    - name: cost_analysis
      enabled: true
      title: "üí∞ OpenAI API Cost Analysis"  # Custom title with emoji
```

**Result:** Section title changed to custom value.

## Technical Details

### Cost Calculation Flow

1. **During Experiment:**
   ```python
   # In metrics_collector.py
   cost_breakdown = cost_calculator.calculate_cost(
       tokens_in, tokens_out, cached_tokens
   )
   metrics['COST_USD'] = cost_breakdown['total_cost']
   ```

2. **During Report Generation:**
   ```python
   # In report_generator.py
   # Read stored COST_USD for totals
   costs = [run['COST_USD'] for run in runs]
   
   # Recalculate breakdowns from tokens (for components)
   breakdown = calc.calculate_cost(
       run['TOK_IN'], run['TOK_OUT'], run['CACHED_TOKENS']
   )
   ```

**Why Recalculate?**
- COST_USD is stored, but not the breakdown
- Recalculating ensures consistency with current pricing
- Allows for price updates without re-running experiments

### Model Pricing Access

```python
# Pass model to cost analysis
cost_config_with_model = {
    **cost_config,
    'model': config.get('model', 'gpt-4o-mini')
}
cost_lines = _generate_cost_analysis(frameworks_data, cost_config_with_model)
```

This gives the function access to:
- Model name for CostCalculator initialization
- Pricing config for the correct model
- Ensures accurate cost recalculation

### Error Handling Strategy

```python
try:
    calc = CostCalculator(model)
    # ... generate tables ...
except Exception as e:
    logger.warning(f"Could not generate cost breakdown: {e}")
    lines.extend([
        "‚ö†Ô∏è Cost breakdown unavailable (pricing data or token counts missing)",
        ""
    ])
```

**Philosophy:**
- Log warnings, don't crash
- Provide helpful error messages
- Degrade gracefully (skip subsection, not whole report)
- User sees what went wrong

```

**Issues:**
- ‚ùå No visibility into API costs
- ‚ùå Can't see cache savings
- ‚ùå No cost budgeting data
- ‚ùå Cost optimization insights unavailable

### After Task 3.6
```markdown
## 2. Relative Performance (Reliable Metrics Only)
[performance tables...]

## Cost Analysis  ‚Üê NEW (if enabled)
### üí∞ Total Cost Comparison
[cost summary table...]

### üìä Cost Breakdown by Component
[component costs...]

### üéØ Cache Efficiency
[cache savings analysis...]

### üìà Cost Distribution by Run
[individual run costs...]

## 3. Kruskal-Wallis H-Tests (Reliable Metrics Only)
[statistical tests...]
```

**Benefits:**
- ‚úÖ Full cost transparency
- ‚úÖ Cache ROI visible
- ‚úÖ Budget planning data
- ‚úÖ Optimization insights
- ‚úÖ Optional (doesn't clutter default reports)

---

## Design Decisions

### 1. Why Disabled by Default?

**Reasoning:**
- Cost data may not always be available (legacy runs)
- Academic research may not care about costs
- Keeps default reports focused on performance
- Users opt-in when relevant

**Alternative Considered:**
- Enable by default ‚Üí Rejected (would show warnings for older data)

### 2. Why Recalculate Breakdowns?

**Reasoning:**
- COST_USD is stored, but not component breakdown
- Allows pricing updates without re-running experiments
- Ensures consistency with current pricing config

**Alternative Considered:**
- Store full breakdown in run data ‚Üí Rejected (increases data size, less flexible)

### 3. Why Four Subsections?

**Reasoning:**
- Different users need different views
- Flags allow customization
- Granular control over what's shown

**Alternative Considered:**
- Fixed single table ‚Üí Rejected (less flexible, information overload)

### 4. Why Graceful Degradation?

**Reasoning:**
- Missing data shouldn't break reports
- Clear error messages help debugging
- Partial data still valuable

**Alternative Considered:**
- Fail hard if data missing ‚Üí Rejected (too fragile)

---
