# Silent Fallback Elimination - Investigation & Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-XX  
**Commits:** 648cad9, bcbd7fc  
**Stage:** Stage 5 - Metrics & Visualization Validation

## Problem Discovery

### Initial Symptom
While validating visualizations, boxplot showed **API calls < 1** for some framework runs (e.g., 2.72 average). This appeared to be an average but was actually revealing a deeper bug.

### Investigation Process

1. **First Hypothesis: HITL Interventions**
   - Thought: HITL interventions might bypass LLM calls
   - **REJECTED:** User observation: "HITL_count = 0 but API_calls = 0"
   - Conclusion: No correlation between HITL and 0 API calls

2. **Deep Dive: Single Run Analysis**
   - Examined BAEs run: `baes/5f9e6eab-dc8b-45ce-b2f2-3c32da8e742a`
   - Found steps 2, 4, 5, 6 all had:
     - `api_calls = 0`
     - `tokens_in = 0, tokens_out = 0`
     - Very short duration (~1-3 seconds)
     - **But `success = True`** ← SUSPICIOUS

3. **Root Cause Discovery**
   - Checked BAEs adapter COMMAND_MAPPING (6 entries)
   - Compared with actual prompt files in `config/prompts/`
   - **MISMATCH FOUND:**
     ```
     Mapping: "Create a Student/Course/Teacher CRUD application"
     Actual:  "Create...with Python, FastAPI, and SQLite."
     
     Mapping: "Implement comprehensive data validation"
     Actual:  "Implement...and error handling."
     
     step_5.txt: "Add pagination..." ← NOT IN MAPPING AT ALL
     step_6.txt: "Add comprehensive UI..." ← NOT IN MAPPING AT ALL
     ```

4. **Silent Fallback Mechanism Found**
   - File: `src/adapters/baes_adapter.py`
   - Lines 286-290 (before fix):
     ```python
     if not requests_list:
         logger.warning(f"No BAEs requests mapped...")
         requests_list = [command_text]  # ← SILENT FALLBACK
     ```
   - **Behavior:** Empty request list → Falls back to original command → Execution attempted but failed silently → No API calls → Reports success anyway

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. Remove Silent Fallback in BAEs Adapter

**File:** `src/adapters/baes_adapter.py`  
**Lines:** 286-297 (new)

```python
if not requests_list:
    error_msg = (
        f"Command not found in COMMAND_MAPPING: '{command_text[:100]}...' "
        f"This indicates a configuration error. "
        f"Available commands: {list(self.COMMAND_MAPPING.keys())}"
    )
    logger.error(error_msg, extra={'run_id': self.run_id, 'step': step_num})
    raise ValueError(error_msg)
```

**Impact:**
- Now fails explicitly with clear error message
- Shows available commands for debugging
- No more silent no-ops

### 2. Fix COMMAND_MAPPING

**File:** `src/adapters/baes_adapter.py`  
**Lines:** 31-44 (updated)

**Changes:**
- Updated 4 existing entries to match exact prompt text
- Added step 5: `"Add pagination and filtering to all list endpoints."`
- Added step 6: `"Add comprehensive user interface for all CRUD operations."`

**Before (6 entries, 2 missing):**
```python
"Create a Student/Course/Teacher CRUD application": [...]
"Add enrollment relationship between Student and Course": [...]
"Add teacher assignment relationship to Course": [...]
"Implement comprehensive data validation": [...]
"Enhance UI with filtering and sorting": [...]  # Wrong text
"Add automated testing": [...]  # Wrong text
```

**After (6 entries, all correct):**
```python
"Create...with Python, FastAPI, and SQLite.": [...]
"Add enrollment relationship...entities.": [...]
"Add teacher assignment relationship...entity.": [...]
"Implement...and error handling.": [...]
"Add pagination and filtering...": [...]  # NEW
"Add comprehensive user interface...": [...]  # NEW
```

### 3. Add Validation Layer

**File:** `src/orchestrator/metrics_collector.py`  
**Method:** `record_step()`  
**Lines:** 78-87 (new validation)

```python
# VALIDATION: Fail-fast on impossible metric values
if api_calls < 1 and success:
    raise ValueError(
        f"Invalid metrics for step {step_num}: api_calls={api_calls} < 1 but success=True. "
        f"This indicates a silent failure in the adapter (likely a command mapping issue). "
        f"Every successful step must make at least 1 API call. "
        f"Step details: command='{command[:100]}...', duration={duration_seconds:.2f}s, "
        f"tokens_in={tokens_in}, tokens_out={tokens_out}, hitl_count={hitl_count}"
    )
```

**Why here?**
- Catches ALL adapters (baes, chatdev, ghspec)
- Validates BEFORE storing invalid data
- Provides rich debugging context
- Enforces "fail fast, fail loudly" principle

### 4. Bonus: Fix Overlapping Labels in Boxplot

**File:** `src/analysis/visualizations.py`  
**Method:** `_create_boxplot()`  
**Lines:** 1195-1220

**What:** Smart label positioning for Avg/Med annotations  
**How:** Uses 5% separation threshold to position labels above/below based on value proximity

## Impact & Validation

### Before Fixes
- Steps could silently fail (0 API calls, 0 tokens)
- Still report `success = True`
- Invalid metrics stored and aggregated
- Charts showed misleading values (API calls < 1)
- Impossible to debug without deep investigation

### After Fixes
- Explicit errors on unmapped commands
- Validation prevents invalid metrics from being stored
- Clear error messages with debugging context
- All failures are traceable and fixable
- Charts will never show impossible values

### Testing Strategy
1. Run experiment with BAEs adapter
2. Should now succeed with all 6 steps mapped correctly
3. If any adapter has similar bugs, validation will catch them immediately
4. Error messages will guide to exact fix location

## Lessons Learned

### Pattern: Silent Fallback = Hidden Bug
- Silent fallbacks mask configuration errors
- Lead to "successful" executions with no work done
- Create invalid data that propagates through analysis
- Very difficult to debug post-hoc

### Solution: Fail Fast, Fail Loudly
- **Never silently fall back** - always raise explicit errors
- **Validate early** - catch impossible values at recording time
- **Provide context** - error messages should guide debugging
- **Test assumptions** - if metrics look wrong, they probably are

### Validation Layers
1. **Adapter level:** Catch configuration errors (command mapping)
2. **Metrics level:** Catch impossible values (API calls < 1)
3. **Analysis level:** Catch missing data (already implemented)

## Related Issues

### GHSpec Adapter
- Also has API calls < 1 in some runs
- Likely similar COMMAND_MAPPING issue
- Will be caught by new validation layer
- Should investigate and fix similarly

### ChatDev Adapter
- No observed issues yet
- Protected by validation layer
- Will fail explicitly if issues arise

## Recommendations

### For Future Development
1. **Never use silent fallbacks** - always explicit errors
2. **Add validation at data recording** - prevent bad data from entering system
3. **Test with actual prompts** - verify mappings match reality
4. **Log verbosely on errors** - provide debugging breadcrumbs
5. **Use type hints + assertions** - catch bugs at development time
