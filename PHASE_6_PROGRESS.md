# Phase 6 Complete: Effect Size Alignment ✅

**Feature**: 012-fix-statistical-report  
**User Story**: US4 - Effect Size Alignment (Priority P2)  
**Status**: **COMPLETE** (5/5 tasks = 100%)  
**Date**: 2025-10-30

## Summary

Phase 6 implemented strict alignment between effect size measures and statistical test types. Effect sizes are now selected based on the test that was performed, ensuring methodological consistency. Parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA, Welch's variants) use Cohen's d, while non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis) use Cliff's Delta.

## Tasks Completed (5/5 = 100%)

✅ **T035**: Created `_select_effect_size_measure()` method with parametric/non-parametric logic  
✅ **T036**: Updated `_calculate_effect_sizes()` to use test type for measure selection  
✅ **T037**: Added validation to raise error if measure doesn't align with test type  
✅ **T038**: Set EffectSize.test_type_alignment field to track which test was used  
✅ **T039**: Enhanced educational content to explain measure-test alignment  

## Technical Implementation

### Core Selection Logic (T035)

**Location**: `src/paper_generation/statistical_analyzer.py` lines ~1100-1123  
**Size**: ~24 lines of code

**Signature**:
```python
def _select_effect_size_measure(self, test_type: TestType) -> EffectSizeMeasure:
    """
    Select appropriate effect size measure based on test type.
    
    Implements FR-013, FR-014: Match effect size to test assumptions
    - Parametric tests (t-test, ANOVA, Welch's variants) → Cohen's d
    - Non-parametric tests (Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis) → Cliff's Delta
    """
```

**Mapping**:
- **Parametric → Cohen's d**: T_TEST, WELCH_T, ANOVA, WELCH_ANOVA
- **Non-parametric → Cliff's Delta**: MANN_WHITNEY, KRUSKAL_WALLIS
- **Validation**: Raises ValueError for unknown test types

**Contract Compliance**:
- FR-013: Cohen's d used for parametric tests ✅
- FR-014: Cliff's Delta used for non-parametric tests ✅

### Effect Size Calculation Update (T036-T038)

**Location**: `src/paper_generation/statistical_analyzer.py` lines ~1603-1733  
**Changes**: ~130 lines modified

**Key Enhancements**:

1. **New Parameter** (T036):
   ```python
   def _calculate_effect_sizes(
       self,
       metric_name: str,
       metric_data: Dict[str, List[float]],
       distributions: List[MetricDistribution],
       test_results: List[StatisticalTest] = None  # NEW
   ) -> List[EffectSize]:
   ```

2. **Test Type Lookup** (T036):
   ```python
   # Build test type map for pairwise comparisons
   test_type_map = {}
   if test_results:
       for test in test_results:
           if test.metric_name == metric_name and len(test.groups) == 2:
               key = tuple(sorted(test.groups))
               test_type_map[key] = test.test_type
   ```

3. **Measure Selection** (T036):
   ```python
   comparison_key = tuple(sorted([group1, group2]))
   
   if comparison_key in test_type_map:
       test_type = test_type_map[comparison_key]
       measure = self._select_effect_size_measure(test_type)  # FR-013, FR-014
   else:
       # Fallback: normality check (backward compatibility)
       both_normal = (p1 > self.alpha) and (p2 > self.alpha)
       measure = EffectSizeMeasure.COHENS_D if both_normal else EffectSizeMeasure.CLIFFS_DELTA
   ```

4. **Validation** (T037):
   ```python
   else:
       # This should never happen if selection logic is correct
       raise ValueError(f"Invalid effect size measure selected: {measure}")
   ```

5. **Test Type Alignment Field** (T038):
   ```python
   effect = EffectSize(
       measure=measure,
       metric_name=metric_name,
       group1=group1,
       group2=group2,
       value=float(effect_value),
       ci_lower=ci_lower,
       ci_upper=ci_upper,
       magnitude=magnitude,
       interpretation=interpretation,
       bootstrap_iterations=10000,
       ci_method="bootstrap",
       ci_valid=ci_valid,
       test_type_alignment=test_type if test_type else None  # T038: NEW
   )
   ```

**Caller Update**:
```python
# Before:
effects = self._calculate_effect_sizes(metric_name, metric_data, metric_distributions)

# After (T036):
effects = self._calculate_effect_sizes(
    metric_name, metric_data, metric_distributions, test_results
)
```

### Educational Content Enhancement (T039)

**Location**: `src/paper_generation/educational_content.py` lines ~212-288  
**Changes**: ~15 lines added

**Enhancement**:
Added test type alignment explanation in `explain_effect_size()` method:

```python
# T039: Add test type alignment explanation (FR-015)
if hasattr(effect, 'test_type_alignment') and effect.test_type_alignment:
    test_name = effect.test_type_alignment.value.replace('_', ' ').title()
    if measure_key == "cohens_d":
        explanation.append(f"\n*Note:* Cohen's d is used here because the analysis employed {test_name}, ")
        explanation.append(f"a parametric test that assumes normally distributed data. Cohen's d measures ")
        explanation.append(f"the difference in means relative to pooled standard deviation.\n")
    elif measure_key == "cliffs_delta":
        explanation.append(f"\n*Note:* Cliff's Delta is used here because the analysis employed {test_name}, ")
        explanation.append(f"a non-parametric test that does not assume normal distributions. Cliff's Delta ")
        explanation.append(f"measures ordinal dominance (how often one group exceeds the other).\n")
```

**Example Output**:
> ### 📏 Effect Size: Cohen's d
>
> **What is Cohen's d?**
> Cohen's d measures the difference between two group means...
>
> *Note:* Cohen's d is used here because the analysis employed Student's T Test, a parametric test that assumes normally distributed data. Cohen's d measures the difference in means relative to pooled standard deviation.
