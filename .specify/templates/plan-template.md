# Implementation Plan: [FEATURE]

**Branch**: `[###-feature-name]` | **Date**: [DATE] | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: [e.g., Python 3.11, Swift 5.9, Rust 1.75 or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Primary Dependencies**: [e.g., FastAPI, UIKit, LLVM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Storage**: [if applicable, e.g., PostgreSQL, CoreData, files or N/A]  
**Testing**: [e.g., pytest, XCTest, cargo test or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Target Platform**: [e.g., Linux server, iOS 15+, WASM or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]
**Project Type**: [single/web/mobile - determines source structure]  
**Performance Goals**: [domain-specific, e.g., 1000 req/s, 10k lines/sec, 60 fps or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Constraints**: [domain-specific, e.g., <200ms p95, <100MB memory, offline-capable or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]  
**Scale/Scope**: [domain-specific, e.g., 10k users, 1M LOC, 50 screens or NEEDS CLARIFICATION]

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

Verify compliance with BAEs Experiment Constitution v1.2.0:

- [ ] **Scientific Reproducibility**: Are random seeds fixed? Framework versions pinned?
- [ ] **Clarity & Transparency**: All modules documented? Logs structured as JSON?
- [ ] **Open Science**: Code licensed CC BY 4.0? No proprietary dependencies?
- [ ] **Minimal Dependencies**: Using standard library + PyYAML/requests/pytest only?
- [ ] **Deterministic HITL**: Clarifications automated via `config/hitl/expanded_spec.txt`?
- [ ] **Reproducible Metrics**: Metrics verified against OpenAI Usage API?
- [ ] **Version Control Integrity**: Framework commit hashes pinned in config?
- [ ] **Automation-First**: All steps executable via `run_experiment.sh`?
- [ ] **Failure Isolation**: Each run in isolated workspace with unique run ID?
- [ ] **Educational Accessibility**: Documentation beginner-friendly? Code follows PEP 8?
- [ ] **DRY Principle**: No code duplication? Shared logic in base classes/utilities?
- [ ] **No Backward Compatibility Burden**: Each experiment is independent? Breaking changes acceptable?
- [ ] **Fail-Fast Philosophy**: No fallback mechanisms? Errors fail immediately with clear messages?

## Complexity Tracking

*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
