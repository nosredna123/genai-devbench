# Specification Quality Checklist: GHSpec-Kit Integration Enhancement

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: October 27, 2025  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS ✓

All content focuses on business requirements and user value:
- User stories describe researcher needs and experiment workflows
- No mention of specific Python classes, frameworks, or implementation patterns
- Success criteria use user-facing metrics (completion rates, consistency, resolution rates)
- Language is accessible to stakeholders familiar with experiment design

### Requirement Completeness - PASS ✓

All requirements are clear and testable:
- FR-001 through FR-015 define specific, verifiable capabilities
- Each functional requirement can be validated through testing
- Success criteria SC-001 through SC-010 provide measurable targets with specific percentages and thresholds
- Edge cases cover failure scenarios, resource constraints, and boundary conditions
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all ambiguities resolved through informed defaults

### Feature Readiness - PASS ✓

Feature is ready for planning phase:
- Five prioritized user stories provide complete coverage of enhancement scope
- Each story includes acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
- User stories are independently testable (P1: core workflow, P1: constitution, P2: tech stack, P2: clarification, P3: template sync)
- Success criteria align with functional requirements and provide clear validation targets

## Assumptions Documented

The specification makes the following reasonable assumptions:
1. **Constitution Default**: When no constitution is provided, a default set of principles will be applied (industry-standard practices)
2. **Tech Stack Freedom**: When no tech stack is specified, the AI chooses appropriate technologies based on the specification
3. **Bugfix Iteration Limit**: Maximum of 3 bugfix iterations to prevent infinite loops (standard retry pattern)
4. **Clarification Limit**: Up to 3 clarification iterations per phase (aligned with Spec-Kit guidance)
5. **Performance Target**: 15-minute completion time for typical feature descriptions (based on current observed behavior)
6. **Success Rate Targets**: 95% success rate for automation, 60% for bugfix resolution (based on industry benchmarks)

## Notes

**STATUS**: ✅ ALL VALIDATION ITEMS PASS

The specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`. No further clarifications or updates needed.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of all five enhancement areas
- Clear prioritization with P1 items addressing critical gaps
- Measurable success criteria enable objective validation
- Edge cases demonstrate thorough consideration of failure modes

**Ready for Next Phase**: Yes - proceed to planning
