# Feature Specification: GHSpec-Kit Integration Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `007-integration-of-ghspec`  
**Created**: October 27, 2025  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Integration of GHSpec-Kit in genai-devbench"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-27

- Q: Constitution file size and complexity limits → A: Unlimited: No size constraint, adapter must handle arbitrarily large constitutions
- Q: OpenAI API failure mode handling strategy → A: Fail-fast: Any API failure aborts entire run, no retries, experiment marked failed
- Q: Concurrent experiment execution safety → A: Single-threaded only: No concurrent execution support, sequential runs enforced

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Complete 5-Phase Workflow Execution (Priority: P1)

As a researcher running genai-devbench experiments, I need the GHSpecAdapter to execute all five Spec-Kit phases (Specify, Plan, Tasks, Implement, Bugfix) in sequence for each scenario step, so that I can fairly compare GHSpec-Kit's complete capabilities against other AI development frameworks.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables the experiment. Without a complete workflow, the comparative analysis would be invalid as it wouldn't represent GHSpec-Kit's full methodology.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a single experiment with one feature request (e.g., "Build Hello World API") and verifying that all five artifacts (spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, source code files, and bugfix logs) are generated in the workspace.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a new experiment run with a feature description, **When** execute_step is called, **Then** all five phases execute sequentially (Specify → Plan → Tasks → Implement → Bugfix)
2. **Given** Phase 1 completes successfully, **When** Phase 2 begins, **Then** the spec.md content is available as context for plan generation
3. **Given** Phase 3 completes with a task list, **When** Phase 4 begins, **Then** each task is implemented one-by-one with relevant spec and plan excerpts
4. **Given** Phase 4 generates code with validation errors, **When** Phase 5 executes, **Then** automated bugfix attempts are made using error logs and spec context
5. **Given** all phases complete, **When** artifacts are examined, **Then** spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and source code files exist in the expected workspace structure

### User Story 2 - Project Constitution and Principles (Priority: P1)

As a researcher configuring experiments, I need the ability to define project-level principles and constraints (constitution) that guide all GHSpec-Kit phases, so that the generated code adheres to consistent quality standards, testing requirements, and organizational constraints across all runs.

**Why this priority**: Without a constitution, the AI lacks global guidelines specific to the project, potentially leading to inconsistent outputs across runs and missing the full Spec-Kit experience. This is a foundational element that affects all downstream phases.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring a constitution with specific rules (e.g., "always write unit tests", "follow PEP8 style"), running an experiment, and verifying that the generated code adheres to those principles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a constitution file or configuration is provided, **When** the adapter initializes, **Then** the principles are loaded and available for injection into prompts
2. **Given** project principles are defined, **When** Phase 1 (Specify) executes, **Then** the system prompt includes or references the constitution guidelines
3. **Given** constitution specifies "all code must include unit tests", **When** Phase 4 (Implement) completes, **Then** generated code includes corresponding test files
4. **Given** no constitution is provided, **When** the adapter starts, **Then** a default set of reasonable principles is applied
5. **Given** constitution includes style guidelines (e.g., PEP8), **When** code is generated, **Then** the code follows those style conventions

### User Story 3 - Technology Stack Guidance (Priority: P2)

As a researcher running controlled experiments, I need the ability to specify or constrain the technology stack choices for the Plan phase, so that I can ensure consistency across framework comparisons or align with organizational requirements.

**Why this priority**: Allows for controlled comparisons by ensuring consistent tech stacks across different framework runs, and emulates real-world usage where organizations have preferred technologies.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring a tech stack preference (e.g., "Python 3 + FastAPI + PostgreSQL"), running the Plan phase, and verifying that plan.md reflects those choices.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** tech stack constraints are configured, **When** Phase 2 (Plan) executes, **Then** the plan.md reflects the specified technologies
2. **Given** no tech stack is specified, **When** Phase 2 executes, **Then** the AI chooses appropriate technologies based on the specification
3. **Given** sprint N is executing, **When** Phase 2 runs, **Then** the plan maintains tech stack consistency with sprint N-1
4. **Given** organizational constraints are defined (e.g., "must use AWS services"), **When** the plan is generated, **Then** infrastructure choices align with those constraints

---

### User Story 4 - Enhanced Clarification Handling (Priority: P2)

As a researcher ensuring robust automation, I need the adapter to handle multiple rounds of AI clarification requests (up to 3 iterations per phase), so that ambiguous feature descriptions are fully resolved without manual intervention.

**Why this priority**: Ensures the adapter can handle complex scenarios where a single clarification response isn't sufficient, aligning with Spec-Kit's guidance of up to 3 clarification questions.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by providing an intentionally ambiguous feature description, observing clarification handling, and verifying that the adapter attempts up to 3 clarification cycles before proceeding.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the AI requests clarification in a phase, **When** clarification guidelines are provided, **Then** the prompt is regenerated with the clarification response
2. **Given** the AI requests clarification a second time, **When** additional guidelines are available, **Then** a second clarification iteration occurs
3. **Given** three clarification iterations have occurred, **When** the AI still requests clarification, **Then** the adapter proceeds with best-effort interpretation and logs a warning
4. **Given** a phase completes without clarification, **When** execution continues, **Then** no unnecessary clarification cycles are attempted

---

### User Story 5 - Prompt Template Synchronization (Priority: P3)

As a maintainer of genai-devbench, I need an option to use prompt templates directly from the cloned GHSpec-Kit repository, so that the adapter automatically benefits from upstream improvements while maintaining reproducibility through versioning.

**Why this priority**: Ensures long-term maintainability and ability to track with Spec-Kit evolution, though current static templates are acceptable for immediate experimentation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by configuring the adapter to use templates from frameworks/ghspec, updating those templates, and verifying the adapter uses the new versions in the next run.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the adapter is configured to use repository templates, **When** templates are loaded, **Then** they are read from frameworks/ghspec/templates/
2. **Given** the adapter is configured for reproducible mode, **When** templates are loaded, **Then** they are read from the static docs/ghspec/prompts/ copies
3. **Given** upstream Spec-Kit introduces a new phase, **When** templates are synchronized, **Then** the adapter can optionally incorporate the new phase logic
4. **Given** a specific Spec-Kit version is configured, **When** the framework is cloned, **Then** that exact version's templates are used

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the AI generates code for a task but specifies an invalid file path (e.g., absolute path outside workspace)?
- How does the system handle cases where Phase 4 generates zero files (empty implementation)?
- What happens when the bugfix phase cannot resolve errors after maximum retry attempts?
- **Network/API Failures**: When network failures or API rate limits occur during multi-phase execution, the adapter aborts the entire run immediately (fail-fast), marks the experiment as failed, and does not attempt retries. This ensures data integrity and clear failure attribution.
- What happens when previous sprint artifacts are corrupted or missing for incremental development?
- How does the system handle extremely large spec or plan documents that exceed context window limits during Phase 4 excerpting?
