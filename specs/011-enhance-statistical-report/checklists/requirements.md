## Validation Results

### ‚úÖ Content Quality - PASS

**Review**:
- Specification focuses on statistical analysis capabilities from researcher's perspective
- No framework-specific implementation details (uses "System MUST" requirements)
- Written for researchers who need statistical rigor in their experiments
- All mandatory sections present: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria

**Evidence**:
- User stories describe researcher needs, not code implementation
- Functional requirements specify WHAT the system must do, not HOW
- Technical Notes section appropriately separated from core specification

---

### ‚úÖ Requirement Completeness - PASS

**Review**:
- All clarification questions resolved with clear design decisions
- **58 functional requirements** covering all aspects of enhanced statistical analysis, **paper integration**, **and educational content**
- **30 success criteria** with specific measurable outcomes **including paper quality and accessibility metrics**
- Edge cases comprehensively identified (7 scenarios)

**Evidence**:
- Design Decisions section documents all resolved questions (Q1: Single MD, Q2: Two versions, Q3: Prescriptive warnings)
- Requirements are specific and testable (e.g., "FR-001: System MUST perform Shapiro-Wilk normality tests on all metrics for each framework with n‚â•3")
- Success criteria include percentages and thresholds (e.g., "SC-001: Reports include normality tests for 100% of metrics with n‚â•3")
- **NEW: Paper integration requirements FR-044 to FR-049 ensure PaperGenerator actively uses statistical artifacts**
- **NEW: Paper quality success criteria SC-019 to SC-024 validate improved scientific rigor in generated papers**
- **NEW: Educational content requirements FR-050 to FR-058 ensure reports are accessible to non-statisticians**
- **NEW: Accessibility success criteria SC-025 to SC-030 validate didactic explanations and user-friendliness**

---

### ‚úÖ Feature Readiness - PASS

**Review**:
- **6 prioritized user stories** (P1, P2, P2, P3, P3, **P1 for educational content**) with clear acceptance scenarios
- Each user story is independently testable as specified
- Success criteria map directly to functional requirements
- Out of Scope section clearly defines boundaries

**Evidence**:
- User Story 1 (P1) can be tested by running experiment and verifying normality tests, effect sizes present
- User Story 2 (P2) can be tested with varying sample sizes to verify power calculations
- User Story 3 (P2) can be tested by checking for embedded visualizations in paper
- **User Story 6 (P1) can be tested by having non-statisticians read report and answer comprehension questions**
- Each FR has corresponding SC for validation

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: ‚úÖ **READY FOR PLANNING**

The specification is complete, well-structured, and ready for the next phase. All quality criteria are met:

1. **Clear User Value**: Researchers get rigorous statistical analysis with publication-quality outputs **that enhance the final generated paper** and **are accessible to varying expertise levels**
2. **Testable Requirements**: All **58** functional requirements can be verified objectively
3. **Measurable Success**: **30** success criteria provide concrete validation targets **including paper quality and user comprehension metrics**
4. **Well-Scoped**: Clear boundaries with comprehensive edge case handling
5. **Design Decisions Resolved**: All three clarification questions answered and documented

**Key Strengths**:
- Comprehensive statistical methodology (normality tests, effect sizes, power analysis)
- Dual-report approach balances accessibility (summary) with completeness (full report)
- Prescriptive power recommendations encourage scientific rigor
- Publication-ready visualizations with rigorous statistical content (box plots, violin plots, forest plots, Q-Q plots)
- **Seamless integration with existing paper generation pipeline**: Statistical analysis in Step 1, separate `figures/statistical/` directory, no interference with `FigureExporter`
- **PaperGenerator enhancement ensures statistical artifacts actively improve paper quality**: Statistical visualizations embedded in Results, statistical methodology documented in Methodology section, power limitations discussed in Discussion
- **Structured data flow from analysis to paper**: `StatisticalFindings` entity provides parseable data for PaperGenerator to incorporate into sections
- **Educational content makes statistics accessible**: "What/Why/How" explanations, plain-language interpretations, practical analogies, glossary, Quick Start Guide
- **User-friendly design**: 8th grade reading level for core explanations, emoji icons for navigation, concrete examples for abstract concepts
- Edge cases thoroughly considered
- Clear pipeline architecture showing where statistical enhancements fit **and how they improve the paper**
- **Concrete examples of enhanced paper sections and didactic explanations demonstrate tangible value**

**Next Steps**:
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create detailed implementation plan
- Reference `full-report-sample.md` in feature directory for expected output format
- Ensure all **58** functional requirements are tracked in implementation plan
- **Priority 1a**: Implement ExperimentAnalyzer enhancements (statistical analysis + visualizations)
- **Priority 1b**: Implement educational content helpers (`_format_didactic_explanation()`, `_generate_analogy()`, `_format_plain_language()`)
- **Priority 2**: Implement PaperGenerator enhancements (integrate statistical content into paper sections)
- **Validation**: Test full pipeline end-to-end to ensure paper includes statistical visualizations and content
- **User Testing**: Have non-statistician researchers read reports and verify comprehension (target 90%+ correct answers on interpretation questions)

## Notes

- The specification appropriately uses Technical Notes section for implementation guidance without leaking details into core requirements
- The dual-report generation (FR-024) ensures both summary and full versions are always created together for consistency
- Power analysis prescriptive warnings (Design Decision 3) will encourage researchers to collect adequate samples before drawing conclusions
- Statistical test selection logic in Technical Notes provides clear decision tree for implementation but remains separate from user-facing requirements
- **NEW: `StatisticalFindings` entity (Key Entities section) defines the data structure for passing statistical results from ExperimentAnalyzer to PaperGenerator, ensuring clean separation of concerns**
- **NEW: Example Enhanced Paper Sections (Technical Notes) provide concrete templates for how statistical content appears in final paper**
- **NEW: Paper integration requirements (FR-044 to FR-049) ensure this feature improves the entire paper generation pipeline, not just standalone statistical reports**
- **NEW: Educational Explanation Templates (Technical Notes) provide concrete structure for "What/Why/How" sections with real examples**
- **NEW: Quick Start Guide structure helps users navigate reports efficiently regardless of statistical background**
- **NEW: 8th grade reading level requirement ensures accessibility without sacrificing scientific accuracy**
- **NEW: Emoji icons (üìö, üí°, ‚ö†Ô∏è, ‚úÖ, üéì) provide visual navigation cues for different content types**
