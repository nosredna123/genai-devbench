# Specification Quality Checklist: Fix Zero Tokens Issue in Usage Reconciliation

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-27  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Specification is focused on WHAT and WHY, not HOW:
- No mention of Python, JSON libraries, or specific implementation patterns
- Focused on user needs (accurate token counts, reliable metrics)
- Written in business/research context (framework performance analysis)
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

### Requirement Completeness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - All requirements are well-defined:
- Zero [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers (root cause is well-understood from issue report)
- Requirements use testable language ("MUST query", "MUST store", "MUST remove")
- Success criteria include specific metrics:
  - SC-001: 100% accuracy (eliminate 36-50% error rate)
  - SC-002: Time window (30-1440 minutes)
  - SC-003: Zero token fields in steps (clean data model)
  - SC-004: Verification timeframe (N × MIN_INTERVAL)
- All 3 user stories have Given/When/Then acceptance scenarios
- Edge cases identified: midnight crossing, API failures, old data, zero LLM usage
- Scope bounded with "Out of Scope" section (no sprint-level attribution, no retroactive fixes)
- Dependencies (OpenAI API, existing infrastructure) and assumptions (API behavior) documented

### Feature Readiness Assessment

✅ **Pass** - Feature is ready for planning:
- Each of 10 functional requirements maps to acceptance criteria in user stories
- User scenarios cover: accurate totals (P1), remove misleading data (P2), status reporting (P3)
- Success criteria are measurable and independent of implementation:
  - "100% accurate token counts" (not "API returns correct buckets")
  - "Reconciliation completes in 30-1440 minutes" (not "Code executes within timeout")
  - "No token fields in steps array" (not "Remove fields from JSON serialization")
- No implementation leakage (e.g., doesn't specify Python functions, class names, or data structures)

## Notes

**Specification Status**: ✅ **READY FOR PLANNING**

All checklist items pass. The specification is:
- **Complete**: All mandatory sections filled with concrete details
- **Clear**: No ambiguous requirements or missing clarifications
- **Testable**: Each requirement has verifiable acceptance criteria
- **Technology-agnostic**: Describes outcomes, not implementation details
- **Scoped**: Clear boundaries on what's included and excluded

**Confidence Level**: HIGH - The root cause analysis in the issue report provides exceptional clarity. The problem is well-understood (OpenAI Usage API attributes tokens by completion time, creating bucket misalignment for sequential sprints), and the solution is straightforward (switch from per-sprint to per-run reconciliation).

**Next Steps**: 
- Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan
- No clarifications needed from user
