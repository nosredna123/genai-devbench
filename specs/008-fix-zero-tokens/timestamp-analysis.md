# Timestamp Capture Analysis

## Current Implementation

### Where Timestamps Are Captured

Looking at `src/adapters/baes_adapter.py` lines 233-275:

```python
def execute_step(self, step_num: int, command_text: str):
    start_time = time.time()          # ← Captured BEFORE subprocess call
    start_timestamp = int(time.time())
    
    # ... logging ...
    
    result = self._execute_kernel_request(  # ← Subprocess executes here
        request=command_text,               #   (makes OpenAI API calls)
        start_servers=start_servers
    )
    
    # ... check result ...
    
    duration = time.time() - start_time     # ← Captured AFTER subprocess returns
    end_timestamp = int(time.time())
```

### Timeline of Events

```
T0: start_timestamp captured (e.g., 21:41:05)
T1: subprocess.run() starts
    ├─ BAeS CLI loads
    ├─ First OpenAI API call sent  (21:41:08)
    ├─ ... processing ...
    ├─ More OpenAI API calls      (21:41:15, 21:41:25)
    ├─ Last API call sent         (21:41:38)
    └─ OpenAI response received   (21:41:39)
T2: subprocess.run() returns
T3: end_timestamp captured (e.g., 21:41:41)

OpenAI API Processing:
├─ API call at 21:41:38 enters queue
├─ Response processing completes at 21:42:02 (24 seconds later!)
└─ Tokens attributed to bucket 21:42:00
```

## The Problem

**Yes, we ARE capturing the correct timestamps for OUR code execution!**

The timestamps reflect:
- `start_timestamp`: When our Python code starts the subprocess
- `end_timestamp`: When our Python code receives the subprocess return

**But OpenAI attributes tokens differently:**
- Tokens are attributed based on when **THEIR backend** finishes processing the response
- This can be seconds to minutes after we receive the HTTP response
- This happens INSIDE OpenAI's infrastructure, after the API call completes

## Verification from Issue Report

From Run `8bed2f77-9917-414c-8ffd-155778065cec`:

```
Sprint 1: 21:41:05 - 21:41:41 (our timestamps) ✅ CORRECT
└─ Tokens appear in bucket: 21:42:00 (OpenAI's attribution) ⏰ DELAYED

Sprint 2: 21:41:42 - 21:42:13 (our timestamps) ✅ CORRECT
├─ Query returns bucket 21:42:00 (contains Sprint 1's tokens!)
└─ Query returns bucket 21:43:00 (contains Sprint 2's tokens!)
└─ Total: Sprint 1 + Sprint 2 tokens ❌ WRONG
```

## Why Adding Sleep Won't Fix This

Even if we add sleep between sprints:

```python
# Sprint 1
start: 21:41:05
end:   21:41:41
sleep(60)  # Wait 1 minute

# Sprint 2
start: 21:42:42  # Now in different minute bucket!
end:   21:43:15
```

**But:**
```
Sprint 1's tokens still attributed to 21:42:00 (OpenAI backend delay)
Sprint 2 query (21:42:42-21:43:15) STILL captures 21:42:00 bucket!
└─ Still gets Sprint 1's tokens! ❌
```

The only way to avoid this would be:
```python
sleep(60)  # Wait for next minute boundary
sleep(60)  # PLUS wait for OpenAI backend processing delay
# = 2-5 minutes of idle time between sprints!
```

## Conclusion

✅ **Our timestamps are correct** - they accurately reflect when our code starts/ends the subprocess.

❌ **OpenAI's attribution is asynchronous** - tokens appear in buckets based on their internal processing time, which we cannot control or observe.

💡 **Run-level reconciliation is the only reliable approach** - query the entire run's time window and accept the aggregate total as the ground truth.
