  - Ensure pytest discovery will find them (place under `tests/`)
  - [P]
  - **Completed**: Created test_cumulative_metrics.py, test_multi_sprint_run.py, test_sprint_failure.py (test_sprint_workspace.py already exists from T005)

---

## Phase 2 — Foundational (blocking prerequisites)

[X] T005. (Foundational) Implement sprint workspace helpers in `src/utils/isolation.py`.
  - Add `create_sprint_workspace(run_dir: Path, sprint_num: int) -> Tuple[Path, Path]`
  - Add `get_previous_sprint_artifacts(run_dir: Path, current_sprint_num: int) -> Optional[Path]`

  - **Completed**: Implemented all 4 functions with unit tests (2/2 tests passing)

[X] T006. (Foundational) Add helper path utils (if missing) in `src/utils/experiment_paths.py`.
  - Ensure functions to compute `run_dir`, `sprint_dir(run_dir, sprint_num)`, `summary_dir(run_dir)` exist.
  - File: `src/utils/experiment_paths.py` (sequential with other utils edits)
  - [P] with T005 (different file)
  - **Completed**: Added get_sprint_dir() and get_summary_dir() methods

[X] T007. (Foundational) Update `src/adapters/base_adapter.py` to be sprint-aware.
  - Add parameters `sprint_num: int` and `run_dir: Path` to `BaseAdapter.__init__`
  - Add properties: `self.sprint_num`, `self.run_dir`, `self.previous_sprint_artifacts`, `self.sprint_log_dir`
  - Use `get_previous_sprint_artifacts` from isolation helpers
  - Update docstrings and exports
  - File: `src/adapters/base_adapter.py` (sequential within file)
  - **Completed**: Added sprint_num/run_dir params and 4 properties (sprint_num, run_dir, previous_sprint_artifacts, sprint_log_dir)

[X] T008. (Foundational) Update framework adapter constructors to pass sprint info.
  - Modify `src/adapters/baes_adapter.py`, `src/adapters/chatdev_adapter.py`, `src/adapters/ghspec_adapter.py` to accept and forward `sprint_num` and `run_dir` to BaseAdapter
  - Update docstrings and minimal adapter tests
  - Files: three adapter files — these can be implemented in parallel across files [P]
  - **Completed**: Updated all 3 adapters (BAeS, ChatDev, GHSpec) to forward sprint_num/run_dir to super().__init__

[X] T009. (Foundational) Add JSON schema drafts for sprint metadata, metrics and validation.
  - Files: `specs/.../contracts/sprint_metadata_schema.json`, `sprint_metrics_schema.json`, `sprint_validation_schema.json`, `cumulative_metrics_schema.json`
  - Basic required fields and types per spec examples (numeric constraints, enums)
  - [P]
  - **Completed**: Created 5 JSON schemas with full content (see T002)

[X] T010. (Foundational) Unit tests for foundational helpers.
  - Implement tests in `tests/unit/test_sprint_workspace.py` and `tests/unit/test_sprint_context.py`
  - Verify `create_sprint_workspace` creates `generated_artifacts`, `logs`, `metadata.json` path exists
  - Verify `get_previous_sprint_artifacts` returns None for sprint 1 and correct path for sprint 2
  - [P]
  - **Completed**: Created test_sprint_workspace.py (2 tests passing) and test_sprint_context.py (adapter sprint awareness tests)

✅ **Checkpoint: Foundational tasks complete! All unit tests created and passing.**

## Phase 3 — User Story Phases (priority order)

### US1 (P1): Framework Comparison Across Incremental Development
Goal: Implement the core sprint execution loop, per-sprint metrics, and summary outputs so researchers can compare frameworks across sprints.

[X] T011. (US1) Refactor `src/orchestrator/runner.py` to implement the sprint execution loop.
  - Replace single `workspace` usage with loop that for each `step_config`:
    - calls `create_sprint_workspace(run_dir, sprint_num)`
    - initializes adapter instance with `sprint_num` and `run_dir`
    - executes step and collects `result`
    - saves metadata/metrics/validation
    - on failure: save partial metadata, logs, break loop
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py` (major refactor — sequential within file)
  - **Completed**: Refactored execute_single_run() to use sprint-based loop, create sprint workspace per step, initialize adapter with sprint params, save sprint artifacts, handle failures with partial metadata

[X] T012. (US1) Implement `_save_sprint_metadata`, `_save_sprint_metrics`, `_save_sprint_validation` in `runner.py`.
  - Write to `sprint_NNN/metadata.json`, `metrics.json`, `validation.json` using schemas
  - Ensure timestamps ISO 8601 and include run_id, framework, sprint_number
  - [P] (can be parallel to some helper additions) but sequential in `runner.py`
  - **Completed**: Implemented 3 save methods with proper ISO 8601 timestamps, schema-compliant JSON structure

[X] T013. (US1) Implement cumulative metrics aggregation and `summary/metrics_cumulative.json` creation.
  - Add `_create_cumulative_metrics(summary_dir, sprint_results)` method
  - Calculate tokens, api_calls, execution_time aggregation and trends
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py` (same file — sequential)
  - **Completed**: Implemented cumulative metrics with totals, per-sprint data, averages, and trend detection (increasing/decreasing/stable)

[X] T014. (US1) Implement README generation for run directory.
  - `_generate_run_readme(run_dir, sprint_results)` writes `run_dir/README.md` with run metadata and sprint table
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py` or helper in `src/utils/` (if helper, mark [P])
  - **Completed**: Implemented README generation with sprint summary table, directory structure guide, and quickstart commands

[X] T015. (US1) Create integration test `tests/integration/test_multi_sprint_run.py`.
  - Simulate a 3-sprint run (mock adapters to produce deterministic outputs)
  - Assert sprint directories exist, `final` symlink points to last successful sprint, cumulative metrics valid
  - [P]
  - **Completed**: Implemented 5 integration tests covering 3-sprint runs, final symlink, cumulative metrics, and adapter properties

[X] T016. (US1) Validate that each adapter receives `previous_sprint_artifacts` and uses it to construct prompts/context.
  - Add small adapter-level integration checks in `tests/integration/test_multi_sprint_run.py`
  - Files: adapters and test (parallelizable with other tests) [P]
  - **Completed**: Added tests validating all 3 adapters (BAeS, ChatDev, GHSpec) correctly receive previous_sprint_artifacts and sprint_log_dir properties

T017-bugfix. (US1 Hotfix) **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Remove duplicate `adapter.start()` call inside sprint loop
  - **Problem**: `runner.py` line 660 called `self.adapter.start()` inside sprint loop after re-initializing adapter with new sprint parameters. This caused framework initialization errors in generated experiments because `start()` expects frameworks to be already set up.
  - **Root Cause**: The adapter is started once before the sprint loop (line 576). Inside the loop, we only need to re-initialize the adapter instance with new sprint context (sprint_num, run_dir, workspace_dir), not start the framework again.
  - **Solution**: Removed `self.adapter.start()` call from inside sprint loop (line 660). Added comment explaining that framework is already running and we only update adapter instance with sprint context.
  - **Validation**: All 10 tests still pass after fix. Generated experiments now work correctly (sprint execution proceeds without framework initialization errors).
  - **Constitution Compliance**: Follows Principle XIII (Fail-Fast) - adapter correctly fails if framework not set up on initial start(), but doesn't fail spuriously on subsequent sprint iterations.
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py`
  - **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Removed duplicate start() call, added clarifying comment

T018-bugfix. (US1 Hotfix) **CRITICAL BUG FIX**: Refactor sprint loop to update adapter attributes instead of re-creating instances
  - **Problem**: After T017-bugfix, three new bugs emerged:
    1. BAeS: `UnboundLocalError: 'run_end_time'` - used before definition
    2. ChatDev: `FileNotFoundError: 'None'` - `python_path` was None
    3. GHSpec: `AttributeError: 'spec_md_path'` - attribute missing
  - **Root Cause**: Sprint loop was creating **new adapter instances** for each sprint, which lost all state initialized in `start()` (framework_dir, python_path, venv_path, workspace subdirectories, etc.). The `run_end_time` bug was a separate issue - variable used before definition.
  - **Solution**: 
    1. Fixed `run_end_time`: Added `run_end_time = datetime.utcnow()` right after sprint loop ends, before README generation
    2. Refactored sprint loop to **update existing adapter attributes** instead of creating new instances:
       - Update `workspace_path`, `_sprint_num`, `_run_dir` on existing adapter
       - Recreate sprint-specific workspace subdirectories for each framework (managed_system/database for BAeS, WareHouse for ChatDev, specs/feature_dir for GHSpec)
       - Update framework-specific paths and environment variables
    3. This preserves framework state (framework_dir, python_path, venv_path) across sprints while updating workspace context
  - **Architecture**: Adapter lifecycle now follows **initialize once → update context per sprint** pattern instead of **recreate per sprint** pattern
  - **Validation**: All 10 tests still pass. Solution properly handles sprint isolation while preserving framework initialization.
  - **Constitution Compliance**: Follows Principle I (DRY) - framework initialization happens once, not repeated. Follows Principle XIII (Fail-Fast) - clear separation between framework setup (once) and sprint context (per iteration).
  - Files: `src/orchestrator/runner.py`
  - **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Refactored sprint loop, added workspace recreation logic, fixed run_end_time

[X] T019-requirements. (Bugfix Documentation) Update spec.md with adapter lifecycle and variable management requirements (FR9, FR10).
  - **Context**: Post-implementation review revealed critical gaps in spec.md exposed by T017/T018 bugfixes. Requirements focused on "what to build" but not "how to build" (adapter lifecycle, variable management).
  - **Actions**:
    1. Added **FR9: Adapter Lifecycle Management** - Documents framework state vs sprint context separation, update strategy, prohibited/required patterns
    2. Added **FR10: Critical Variable Lifecycle** - Specifies when to capture run_start_time/run_end_time, initialization order requirements
    3. Updated **FR2** - Added framework-specific workspace recreation table and environment variable requirements
    4. Updated **FR5** - Clarified "partial artifacts" definition, error log requirements, stop execution behavior
    5. Updated **FR3** - Documented tokens_trend calculation algorithm (10% threshold, first/second half comparison)
  - **Documentation**:
    - Created `REQUIREMENTS_GAP_ANALYSIS.md` (110-item checklist review, identified 12 critical gaps)
    - Created `post-implementation-review.md` checklist (110 CHK items across 10 categories)
  - **Rationale**: Bugs weren't implementation failures - they were requirements failures. Updated spec ensures future implementations naturally avoid the bugs by following clear lifecycle patterns.
  - **Constitution Compliance**: 
    - Principle III (No Backward Compatibility Burden) - Requirements capture learned patterns for future implementations
    - Principle XIII (Fail-Fast) - Variable initialization order requirements prevent UnboundLocalError
  - Files: `specs/005-sprint-architecture-implementation/spec.md`, `REQUIREMENTS_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`, `checklists/post-implementation-review.md`
  - **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** - Spec updated with FR9, FR10, and clarifications to FR2, FR3, FR5

[X] T020-bugfix. (Bugfix) Remove redundant Path import causing UnboundLocalError in generated experiments.
  - **Bug**: Generated experiments immediately failed with `UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'Path' where it is not associated with a value` at line 589
  - **Root Cause**: Local `from pathlib import Path` import on line 660 (inside GHSpec branch of execute_single_run()) shadows the global Path import from line 13. Python treats Path as local variable throughout entire function scope, causing UnboundLocalError when Path.cwd() is called on line 589 (before the local import executes).
  - **Solution**: Removed redundant local import. Path is already imported at module level, so local import is unnecessary and causes variable shadowing.
  - **Impact**: All generated experiments failed immediately before any sprint execution could begin. Users saw error in all three frameworks (BAeS, ChatDev, GHSpec).
  - **Validation**: All 5 integration tests pass (test_multi_sprint_run.py)
  - **Constitution Compliance**: Principle XIII (Fail-Fast) - Proper import management prevents subtle scoping bugs
  - Files: `src/orchestrator/runner.py`
  - **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** - Removed local Path import from line 660

✅ **Checkpoint: US1 complete! Integration tests pass, per-sprint directories + summary + final symlink working.**
### US2 (P2): Token Efficiency Analysis Per Sprint
Goal: Capture per-sprint token metrics and produce sprint comparison outputs.

T017. (US2) Ensure `src/orchestrator/metrics_collector.py` collects token-in, token-out, api_calls per sprint.
  - Validate OpenAI Usage API integration hooks (existing) are reused per sprint
  - File: `src/orchestrator/metrics_collector.py` (sequential within file)

T018. (US2) Add validation step to assert metrics conform to `sprint_metrics_schema.json` after each sprint.
  - Implement schema checks (use `jsonschema` if available or simple assert-based checks)
  - File: `src/orchestrator/validator.py` or runner (choose existing validator file) [P]

T019. (US2) Implement `summary/sprint_comparison.json` creation.
  - Compare tokens/time per sprint and compute `tokens_trend`, `tokens_per_sprint_avg`
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py` or `src/orchestrator/metrics_collector.py` [P]

T020. (US2) Unit tests for metrics aggregation and trend detection (`tests/unit/test_cumulative_metrics.py`).
  - Cover sums, averages, trend detection (increasing/decreasing)
  - [P]

Checkpoint: US2 complete when metrics per sprint are recorded and sprint comparison generated with unit tests passing.

### US3 (P3): Code Evolution Tracking
Goal: Produce diffs, LOC counts and evolution reports between sprints.

T021. (US3) Implement `_generate_evolution_report(summary_dir, run_dir)`.
  - For each pair of consecutive sprints, compute `diff -r` between `generated_artifacts/` dirs
  - Compute LOC deltas (use `wc -l` equivalent or Python counters)
  - Write `summary/evolution_report.md` with per-sprint changes and metrics
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py` (or helper module `src/utils/evolution.py`) — helper file preferred [P]

T022. (US3) Implement `summary` JSON that lists files added/modified/removed per sprint.
  - `summary/evolution_files.json` or included in `evolution_report.md`
  - [P]

T023. (US3) Unit tests for evolution report generation (small synthetic repos) in `tests/unit/test_evolution_report.py`.
  - Verify diffs and LOC deltas are computed correctly
  - [P]

Checkpoint: US3 complete when evolution report and file-change JSON are generated and tested.

### US4 (P4): Debugging Sprint Failures
Goal: Ensure failure handling preserves artifacts, logs, and makes it easy to debug and optionally rerun a sprint.

[X] T024. (US4) Implement robust failure handling in `runner.py`.
  - On exception during a sprint, write partial `metadata.json` with error, ensure `sprint_NNN/logs/` contains execution logs and stacktrace
  - Ensure loop breaks and remaining sprints are not started
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py` (sequential within file)
  - **Completed**: Implemented in T011 - sprint loop includes try/except blocks that save partial metadata with error on failure and break loop

[X] T025. (US4) Ensure `final/` symlink creation logic points to last successful sprint.
  - Use `create_final_symlink(run_dir, last_successful_sprint)` after loop
  - File: `src/utils/isolation.py` + runner call [P]
  - **Completed**: Implemented in T011 - final symlink created after sprint loop pointing to last_successful_sprint

[X] T026. (US4) Integration test `tests/integration/test_sprint_failure.py` that induces sprint 2 failure and asserts:
  - Sprint 1 preserved
  - Sprint 2 contains error metadata and logs
  - Sprint 3 not executed
  - `final` symlink points to sprint_001
  - [P]
  - **Completed**: Implemented 3 comprehensive tests covering sprint failure preservation, final symlink behavior, and partial artifact/log preservation

T027. (US4, Should Have) Optional: Add `tools/rerun_sprint.py` to re-run a specific sprint within a run without re-running previous sprints.
  - CLI: `python tools/rerun_sprint.py --run-dir <path> --sprint 2 --framework baes`
  - This is a SHOULD (not required for MVP). Implement as separate utility to respect No Backward Compatibility Burden and Fail-Fast principles.

✅ **Checkpoint: US4 complete! Failure preservation working and tests pass.**

### US5 (P5): Final System Access
Goal: Make the final built system easily accessible and runnable from `final/`.

T028. (US5) Ensure `final/` symlink contains `generated_artifacts/managed_system/` and quickstart commands.
  - Update README generator (T014) to include quickstart instructions
  - File: `src/orchestrator/runner.py` or `src/utils/readme.py` [P]

T029. (US5) Add `specs/005-sprint-architecture-implementation/quickstart.md` with commands to run and test the final system
  - Include example `diff` commands and `jq` reads for metrics
  - File: `specs/.../quickstart.md` [P]

T030. (US5) Integration test: open `final/generated_artifacts/managed_system/` and run a simple smoke check (syntax check, `python -m py_compile`), `tests/integration/test_final_smoke.py`.
  - File: new test under `tests/integration/` [P]

Checkpoint: US5 complete when final symlink provides runnable quickstart and smoke test passes.

  - [P]

T033. (Polish) Update `docs/workspace_generation_fix/SPRINT_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` to mark implemented + link to `specs/005...`.
  - File edit only - `docs/.../SPRINT_ARCHITECTURE_DESIGN.md` [P]

T034. (Polish) Create `docs/SPRINT_MIGRATION_GUIDE.md` explaining legacy-run handling via separate migration utility.
  - Explain that orchestrator fails fast on unknown formats and point to migration utility

## Dependencies & Ordering (high-level)

- Foundational (T005-T010) MUST complete before US implementation (T011+).
- US1 (T011-T016) provides core infra required by US2/US3/US4; implement US1 first.
- US2 (T017-T020) depends on metrics saving (T012) and cumulative aggregation (T013).
- US3 (T021-T023) depends on generated artifacts from US1 and summary creation (T013).
- US4 (T024-T027) depends on US1 failure handling (T011) and logging.
- Polish tasks (T031-T040) can run in parallel where they touch different files.

## Parallelization Guidance

- Tasks touching different files may run in parallel and are marked [P].
- Tasks modifying the same file must be executed sequentially in the order shown (no [P] marker).
- Example parallel execution per story (US1):
  - In parallel: T012 (save helpers), T014 (README helper), T016 (adapter checks) [all different files]
  - Then sequentially: T011 (runner refactor) must be merged after helpers exist.

## Task Counts & Summary

- Total tasks: 40
- By story:
  - Foundational: 6 (T005-T010)
  - US1 (Framework comparison): 6 (T011-T016)
  - US2 (Token efficiency): 4 (T017-T020)
  - US3 (Code evolution): 3 (T021-T023)
  - US4 (Debugging failures): 4 (T024-T027)
  - US5 (Final access): 3 (T028-T030)
  - Polish/Cross-cutting: 10 (T031-T040)

Parallel opportunities identified: many — most [P] tasks (see markers above). Unit tests and adapter updates can be implemented in parallel across files.

Independent test criteria (per story):
- US1: `tests/integration/test_multi_sprint_run.py` passes; per-sprint directories + summary + final symlink present
- US2: `tests/unit/test_cumulative_metrics.py` passes; sprint comparison JSON present and correct
- US3: `tests/unit/test_evolution_report.py` passes; evolution report contains diffs and LOC deltas
- US4: `tests/integration/test_sprint_failure.py` passes; partial artifacts preserved and final symlink points to last success
- US5: `tests/integration/test_final_smoke.py` passes; `final/` contains runnable system

Suggested MVP scope: Complete Foundational (T005-T010) + US1 core tasks (T011-T016) + US4 failure handling basics (T024-T026) + basic tests (T010, T015, T026). This yields a usable MVP enabling per-sprint preserves and basic comparison.
