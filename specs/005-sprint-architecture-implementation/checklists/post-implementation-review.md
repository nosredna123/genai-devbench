**Next Steps After Checklist Review**:
1. Identify CHK items marked as incomplete
2. Prioritize by: Critical bugs > Edge cases > Documentation
3. Update spec.md/plan.md with missing requirements
4. Create follow-up tasks in tasks.md for gaps
5. Re-run tests after requirement updates

**Usage Notes**:
- Check each item against spec.md, plan.md, and implementation
- Mark items as complete only if requirement is explicit, clear, and testable
- For incomplete items, note whether gap is: spec issue, plan issue, or both
- Use this as input for spec/plan refinement before final commit
