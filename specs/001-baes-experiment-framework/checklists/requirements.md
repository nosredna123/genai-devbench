# Specification Quality Checklist: BAEs Experiment Framework

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2025-10-08  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

**Notes**: Specification intentionally avoids implementation details. User stories focus on researcher workflows and scientific outcomes. All sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete.

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

**Notes**: 
- **All 3 NEEDS CLARIFICATION markers resolved** (see [decisions.md](../decisions.md))
  - Decision 1: Failed steps â†’ terminate and restart
  - Decision 2: Step timeout â†’ 10 minutes
  - Decision 3: Artifact archival â†’ full workspace
  - Decision 4: Framework testing order â†’ External frameworks first (P1), BAEs integration (P2), comparison (P3)
- All 29 functional requirements are testable with clear acceptance criteria (added FR-024 for prompt content validation)
- 16 success criteria defined with specific metrics (time bounds, percentages, counts)
- 9 edge cases documented with explicit handling strategies (includes framework protocol adaptation handling)
- Scope bounded to three frameworks, six steps, specific metric set
- 10 assumptions (including framework adaptation policy and prompt content specification) and 6 constraints documented

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

**Notes**: 
- 5 user stories (P1-P3) cover complete research workflow: single run (external frameworks) â†’ BAEs integration â†’ comparison â†’ reproducibility â†’ analysis
- All clarifications resolved with documented decisions in [decisions.md](../decisions.md)
- Strategic testing order: validate orchestrator with ChatDev/Spec-kit first (P1), then integrate BAEs (P2), finally run comparative analysis (P3)
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` phase

## ~~Clarifications Required~~

**Status**: âœ… **ALL RESOLVED** (2025-10-08, updated 2025-01-08)

All clarifications have been resolved. See [decisions.md](../decisions.md) for detailed decision records:
- **Decision 1**: Failed Step Retry Policy â†’ Option A (terminate and restart)
- **Decision 2**: Step Timeout Policy â†’ Option B modified (10 minutes per step)
- **Decision 3**: Artifact Archival Scope â†’ Option A (full workspace)
- **Decision 4**: Framework Testing Order Strategy â†’ Option B (external frameworks first, BAEs second, comparison last)

## Validation Status

**Overall Status**: âœ… **READY FOR PLANNING**

**Next Steps**:
1. âœ… All clarifications resolved
2. âœ… Specification updated with decisions
3. âœ… Checklist validated - all items pass
4. ðŸŽ¯ **Proceed to `/speckit.plan` for implementation planning**

**Blocking Issues**: None

**Non-Blocking Observations**:
- Specification is comprehensive and well-structured
- User stories are independently testable with clear priorities
- Strategic testing order reduces risk: validate orchestrator with stable external frameworks (ChatDev, Spec-kit) before integrating BAEs, which may need protocol modifications
- Functional requirements cover all aspects: orchestration, metrics, validation, artifacts, analysis, automation
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic
- Edge cases thoughtfully addressed including framework adaptation handling
- All decisions documented with rollback instructions for future adjustments
- Clear separation between read-only adapters (external frameworks) and modifiable integration (BAEs)
