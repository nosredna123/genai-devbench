# Specification Quality Checklist: Camera-Ready Paper Generation from Experiment Results

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-28
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

**Validation Complete - All Checks Passed**

### Changes Made (2025-10-28):

1. **Removed Implementation Details**:
   - Removed all code examples (Python CLI architecture, error handling, citation placeholder logic)
   - Removed technology-specific mentions (Pandoc, Matplotlib, LaTeX, pdflatex, Docker, OpenAI API)
   - Removed "Implementation Architecture" section entirely
   - Removed file extension details (.cls, .bst, .tex, .md)

2. **Made Success Criteria Technology-Agnostic**:
   - SC-001: "compiles to camera-ready PDF" (removed pdflatex)
   - SC-003: "visibly marked" (removed specific tag format)
   - SC-005: "meet publication quality standards" (removed PDF/PNG specifics)
   - SC-006: "required dependencies" (removed Pandoc)
   - SC-009: "helpful error messages" (removed Python stack traces)

3. **Updated Functional Requirements**:
   - FR-011: "editable source files in format accepted by conferences" (removed LaTeX/Pandoc)
   - FR-017: "publication-ready formats" (removed PDF/PNG 300+ DPI)
   - FR-021-024: "document processing tools" (removed Pandoc specifics)
   - FR-026: "environment requirements" (removed Python version)
   - FR-032-036: Generalized CLI to "command-line interface" (removed scripts/ directory)

4. **Clarified User Choices**:
   - Q1 (Output Format): Option B - Editable source files accepted by ACM SIGSOFT
   - Q2 (AI Generation Scope): Option A - Generate complete paper drafts (80% automation)
   - Q3 (Citation Handling): Option A - Placeholder descriptions, manual citation filling

**Specification is now ready for `/speckit.plan` phase.**
