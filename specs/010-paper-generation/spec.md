# Feature Specification: Camera-Ready Paper Generation from Experiment Results

**Feature Branch**: `010-paper-generation`  
**Created**: 2025-10-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Depends On**: Feature 009-refactor-analysis-module (requires refactored MetricsConfig-driven report generator)  
**Input**: User description: "Generate camera-ready scientific papers in ACM SIGSOFT format from experiment results with AI-generated comprehensive prose, statistical analysis, auto-generated figures, and full reproducibility package"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Researcher Generates Publication Draft (Priority: P1)

A researcher completes a multi-framework comparison experiment and needs a camera-ready paper draft suitable for submission to top CS/SE conferences (ICSE, FSE, ASE, etc.) with minimal manual editing.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - automate 80% of paper writing effort, allowing researchers to focus on high-level insights and refinement rather than boilerplate content generation.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running a complete experiment with 3+ frameworks, generating the paper, and verifying: (1) all sections present (abstract through conclusion), (2) statistical tables formatted correctly, (3) figures embedded, (4) output compiles to camera-ready PDF matching ACM SIGSOFT format, (5) references section includes citation placeholders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an experiment with complete statistical results, **When** paper generation is requested, **Then** a complete editable document is generated with abstract, introduction (full prose), related work (full prose with citation placeholders), detailed methodology (full prose), comprehensive results with statistics (full prose), discussion (full prose), and conclusion (full prose)
2. **Given** the experiment includes multiple metrics and statistical tests, **When** the results section is generated, **Then** it includes AI-generated prose descriptions of key findings with embedded statistical evidence (p-values, effect sizes, confidence intervals), all marked as AI-generated content requiring review
3. **Given** the paper is generated, **When** compiled to PDF, **Then** it produces a valid camera-ready document matching ACM SIGSOFT conference formatting requirements (2-column layout, correct margins, fonts, spacing)
4. **Given** the related work section is generated, **When** examining the source, **Then** all citations use placeholder format indicating where references are needed without hallucinated bibliographic entries

---

### User Story 2 - Researcher Customizes Paper Output (Priority: P2)

A researcher wants control over which sections to generate, whether to include specific metrics, and how detailed the analysis prose should be.

**Why this priority**: Different venues have different requirements; researchers need flexibility to tailor output without extensive manual editing.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by using various configuration options to control section generation, metric filtering, and prose detail level, then verifying the generated paper respects these settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a researcher specifies selected sections for full prose generation, **When** the paper is generated, **Then** only specified sections contain comprehensive prose while others contain structural outlines
2. **Given** a researcher filters to specific metric categories (e.g., efficiency, cost), **When** the paper is generated, **Then** only selected metric categories appear in tables and analysis prose
3. **Given** a researcher selects minimal prose detail level, **When** results are generated, **Then** prose focuses on direct numerical observations without causal interpretations

---

### User Story 3 - Researcher Exports Publication Figures (Priority: P2)

A researcher needs high-quality visualizations in formats suitable for publication and supplementary materials.

**Why this priority**: Figures must meet publication standards (high resolution, scalable formats, proper labeling).

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by exporting figures and verifying all generated files meet publication quality standards and can be embedded in paper documents.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** an experiment with statistical results, **When** figure export is requested, **Then** all metric comparison plots, cost breakdowns, and distribution charts are exported in publication-ready formats
2. **Given** figures are exported, **When** examining file properties, **Then** images have resolution â‰¥300 DPI and include scalable vector versions where applicable
3. **Given** figures are generated, **When** the paper is compiled, **Then** all figures are correctly embedded with descriptive captions and labels

---

### User Story 4 - Researcher Uses Enhanced Documentation (Priority: P2)

A researcher needs clear, comprehensive documentation in the generated experiment project explaining how to reproduce the experiment and analysis results.

**Why this priority**: Reproducibility is critical for scientific validity, but the standalone generator already creates reproducible experiments - we just need better documentation explaining how to use them.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by following the generated README.md reproduction section on a fresh system and verifying all steps work without external help.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** paper generation is requested, **When** the experiment project is generated, **Then** the documentation includes a comprehensive "Reproduction" section with environment requirements, dependency installation, execution steps, and expected outputs
2. **Given** the documentation includes reproduction instructions, **When** a researcher follows them on a clean system, **Then** they can successfully run the experiment and regenerate analysis reports
3. **Given** the generated project includes analysis results, **When** examining the documentation, **Then** it clearly identifies which files contain statistical reports, figures, and raw data

### Edge Cases

- What happens when required document processing tools are not installed? (fail with clear installation instructions, not silent degradation)
- How are missing figures handled during document compilation? (placeholder text indicating missing data)
- What if conference template files are missing/corrupted? (re-download from bundled backup)
- How does the system handle experiments with only 1 framework? (skip comparative statistics, focus on descriptive analysis)
- What if the researcher wants to regenerate just figures without full paper? (support figures-only regeneration)

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-28 - Feature Scope Definition

- Q: Should paper generation be a separate feature from core report generator refactoring? â†’ A: Yes, split into Feature 010 - Core refactoring (Feature 009) is substantial standalone work
- Q: What level of prose detail should be generated? â†’ A: **FULL AI-generated prose for ALL sections** (Introduction, Related Work, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion) with manual review markers throughout
- Q: How should Related Work citations be handled? â†’ A: **Citation placeholders** in format `[CITE: description]` to avoid hallucinated references - researcher fills in real citations during review
- Q: Should we target ACM format or generic LaTeX? â†’ A: ACM SIGSOFT format - most SE venues require ACM compliance
- Q: Should document processing tools be auto-installed? â†’ A: No - Detect and fail with clear instructions. Avoids permission issues.
- Q: Should figures be generated during paper creation or on-demand? â†’ A: During paper creation for complete package, but also support figures-only regeneration
- Q: Where should command-line tools be organized? â†’ A: As scripts that can be used both from command line and programmatically
- Q: What should reproducibility package include? â†’ A: **Simplified approach** - No separate containerized package. Instead, enhance generated experiment documentation with comprehensive reproduction instructions (environment requirements, dependencies, execution steps, expected outputs). Standalone generator already creates reproducible projects.

### Session 2025-10-28 - Risk Mitigation

- **AI-Generated Content Risk**: User will manually review all generated papers before submission. System visibly marks ALL prose for comprehensive review.
- **Citation Hallucination Risk**: Use placeholder format indicating where citations are needed instead of generating fake references. Researcher fills real citations during review.
- **Document Compilation Risk**: Bundle known-good conference template version to ensure reproducibility
- **Dependency Availability Risk**: Fail-fast with instructions rather than silent degradation
- **Figure Quality Risk**: Export both scalable and high-resolution raster formats to ensure venue compatibility
- **Scope Creep Risk**: Full prose generation for all sections is ambitious (â‰¥800 words per section Ã— 6 sections = â‰¥4800 words total). User acknowledges increased implementation time (4-5 weeks vs 3-4 weeks) and commits to careful manual review.

## Assumptions

- Feature 009 (refactored report generator with MetricsConfig) is complete and working
- Researchers have basic document editing knowledge for final refinement (not complete beginners)
- Required document processing tools are available or can be installed by users
- ACM SIGSOFT template is the target format (not IEEE, Springer, or others)
- Researchers will manually validate all AI-generated causal claims before submission
- Users can follow installation instructions for missing dependencies

## Dependencies

- **Feature 009**: Refactored report_generator.py with MetricsConfig-driven metrics, fail-fast validation
- **Document Processing**: System-level tools for format conversion and compilation
- **Visualization Library**: For generating publication-quality figures
- **Conference Template**: ACM SIGSOFT formatting files (bundled with system)
- **AI Service**: For prose generation across all sections (Introduction, Related Work, Methodology, Results, Discussion, Conclusion)

## Non-Goals

- **Interactive Paper Editing**: No web UI or WYSIWYG editor (source files only)
- **Multi-Format Support**: Only ACM SIGSOFT (not IEEE, Springer, arXiv-specific formats) in v1
- **Automated Submission**: No integration with conference submission systems
- **Bibliography Management**: Researcher provides own bibliography and fills citation placeholders (not auto-generated)
- **Multi-Language Support**: English prose only
- **Real-time Generation**: Papers generated post-experiment, not during execution
- **AI Model Customization**: Use standard AI services (no custom model training for prose generation)
- **Plagiarism Checking**: Researcher's responsibility to validate originality and uniqueness of AI-generated prose
- **Actual Citation Generation**: System generates citation placeholders only, not real bibliographic entries
- **Containerized Reproducibility**: Simplified approach using enhanced documentation instead of full container packaging (standalone generator already creates reproducible projects)

## Technical Constraints

- Must work across major operating systems (Linux, macOS, Windows)
- Generated documents must compile with standard conference template distribution
- Document processing must preserve mathematical notation
- Figure generation must work in headless environments (no display required)
- Total output size (paper + figures + documentation) should be <100MB
- Paper generation should complete in â‰¤3 minutes for typical experiments (50 runs, 3 frameworks)
- Generated output should be portable across systems
