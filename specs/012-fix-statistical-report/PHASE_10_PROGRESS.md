# Phase 10 Progress: Neutral Statistical Language

**Status**: ✅ COMPLETE (7/7 tasks)  
**Priority**: P3 (Quality Enhancement)  
**User Story**: US8 - Replace causal language with neutral descriptive language

---

## Overview

Phase 10 implements **neutral statistical language** throughout the reporting system, replacing causal terms like "outperforms" with descriptive comparative language like "shows higher values than". This is critical for scientific accuracy when reporting associative (not experimental) analyses.

**Key Achievement**: All interpretation text now uses neutral language that describes observed differences without making causal claims, with special awareness of statistical power when interpreting non-significant results.

---

## Tasks Completed

### T060: Neutral Language Helper Method ✅

**What**: Created `_get_interpretation_language()` method with comprehensive neutral phrase dictionary

**Location**: `src/paper_generation/educational_content.py` (lines 230-280)

**Implementation**:
```python
def _get_interpretation_language(self, context: str = "comparison") -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Provide neutral, descriptive phrases for statistical interpretations.
    
    Avoids causal language (outperforms, is better, beats) in favor of
    descriptive comparative language (differs from, shows higher values).
    """
    language = {
        # Comparison phrases (FR-035, FR-036)
        "higher": "shows higher values than",
        "lower": "shows lower values than",
        "differs": "differs from",
        "exceeds": "exceeds",
        "systematically_higher": "has systematically higher values compared to",
        "systematically_lower": "has systematically lower values compared to",
        
        # Effect size phrases
        "positive_effect": "positive difference favoring",
        "negative_effect": "negative difference favoring",
        "magnitude": "the magnitude of difference is",
        
        # Cliff's Delta extreme values (FR-037)
        "cliffs_all_higher": "all observed values in {group1} exceed those in {group2}",
        "cliffs_all_lower": "all observed values in {group1} are less than those in {group2}",
        
        # Non-significant with low power (FR-038)
        "insufficient_evidence_low_power": "insufficient evidence to detect a difference (achieved power: {power:.1%})",
        "insufficient_evidence": "insufficient evidence to conclude a difference exists",
        "cannot_rule_out": "cannot rule out the possibility of a difference with current sample size",
        "power_limited": "the current sample size limits our ability to detect differences (power: {power:.1%})",
        
        # Terms to avoid
        "avoid": [
            "outperforms", "underperforms", "is better than", "is worse than",
            "beats", "loses to", "superior", "inferior",
            "100% certain", "definitely proves", "demonstrates superiority",
            "no effect exists", "proves there is no difference"
        ]
    }
    
    return language
```

**Contract Compliance**: FR-035 to FR-038

---

### T061: Replace "outperforms" in Templates ✅

**What**: Updated all instances of "outperforms/underperforms" to neutral language

**Locations Modified**:

1. **educational_content.py** (line 357):
   - **Before**: `direction = "outperforms" if effect.value > 0 else "underperforms"`
   - **After**: Uses `_get_interpretation_language()` with conditional logic for neutral phrases

2. **statistical_analyzer.py** (lines 1802-1810):
   - **Before**: 
     ```python
     f"{group1} {'outperforms' if effect_value > 0 else 'underperforms'} "
     f"{group2} by {abs(effect_value):.2f} pooled standard deviations."
     ```
   - **After**:
     ```python
     if effect_value > 0:
         direction_phrase = f"shows higher values than"
     elif effect_value < 0:
         direction_phrase = f"shows lower values than"
     else:
         direction_phrase = f"shows similar values to"
     
     f"{group1} {direction_phrase} "
     f"{group2} by {abs(effect_value):.2f} pooled standard deviations."
     ```

**Example Output Change**:
- **Before**: "GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 by 0.85 pooled standard deviations."
- **After**: "GPT-4 shows higher values than GPT-3.5 by 0.85 pooled standard deviations."

**Contract Compliance**: FR-035

---

### T062: Update Effect Size Interpretations ✅

**What**: Replaced "is better than" with descriptive phrases in effect size interpretations

**Location**: `src/paper_generation/educational_content.py` (lines 355-395)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Use neutral language instead of causal
lang = self._get_interpretation_language()

if effect.measure == EffectSizeMeasure.CLIFFS_DELTA:
    # Special handling (see T063)
    ...
else:
    # Cohen's d or other measures
    if effect.value > 0:
        direction_phrase = f"{lang['higher']} {effect.group2}"
    elif effect.value < 0:
        direction_phrase = f"{lang['lower']} {effect.group2}"
    else:
        direction_phrase = f"shows similar values to {effect.group2}"

explanation.append(f"\nBottom line: {effect.group1} {direction_phrase} ")
explanation.append(f"with a **{effect.magnitude}** effect size.\n")
```

**Example Output Change**:
- **Before**: "Bottom line: GPT-4 outperforms GPT-3.5 with a **large** practical difference."
- **After**: "Bottom line: GPT-4 shows higher values than GPT-3.5 with a **large** effect size."

**Contract Compliance**: FR-036

---

### T063: Special Handling for Extreme Cliff's Delta ✅

**What**: Updated Cliff's Delta = ±1.000 interpretation to avoid "100% certain X beats Y"

**Location**: `src/paper_generation/statistical_analyzer.py` (lines 1821-1852)

**Implementation**:
```python
# Special handling for extreme Cliff's Delta values (FR-037)
if abs(effect_value) >= 0.999:
    # Extreme case: all values in one group exceed the other
    if effect_value > 0:
        dominance_phrase = (
            f"all observed values in {group1} exceed those in {group2}"
        )
    else:
        dominance_phrase = (
            f"all observed values in {group1} are less than those in {group2}"
        )
else:
    # Normal case: probability interpretation with neutral language
    probability = abs(effect_value) * 50 + 50
    if effect_value > 0:
        dominance_phrase = (
            f"{group1} has systematically higher values compared to {group2} "
            f"(probability: {probability:.1f}%)"
        )
    elif effect_value < 0:
        dominance_phrase = (
            f"{group1} has systematically lower values compared to {group2} "
            f"(probability: {100 - probability:.1f}%)"
        )
    else:
        dominance_phrase = f"{group1} and {group2} show similar distributions"

interpretation = (
    f"Cliff's Delta = {effect_value:.3f} [{ci_lower:.3f}, {ci_upper:.3f}]: "
    f"{magnitude} effect size. "
    f"{dominance_phrase}."
)
```

**Example Output Changes**:

**Extreme Case (δ = 1.000)**:
- **Before**: "Probability that GPT-4 exceeds GPT-3.5 is 100.0%. (100% certain GPT-4 beats GPT-3.5)"
- **After**: "All observed values in GPT-4 exceed those in GPT-3.5."

**Normal Case (δ = 0.650)**:
- **Before**: "Probability that GPT-4 exceeds GPT-3.5 is 82.5%."
- **After**: "GPT-4 has systematically higher values compared to GPT-3.5 (probability: 82.5%)."

**Contract Compliance**: FR-037

---

### T064: Power-Aware Non-Significant Interpretations ✅

**What**: Updated non-significant result interpretations to avoid "no effect exists" when power < 0.80

**Locations Modified**:

1. **Two-group tests** (`src/paper_generation/statistical_analyzer.py`, lines 1189-1208):
```python
# Power-aware interpretation for non-significant results (FR-038)
# Calculate power first to inform interpretation
effect_size = abs(cohens_d(group1_vals, group2_vals))
power_result = self._calculate_power_analysis(
    test_type=test_type,
    effect_size=effect_size,
    n1=len(group1_vals),
    n2=len(group2_vals),
    alpha=self.alpha,
    target_power=0.80
)

# Use neutral language in interpretation
if is_significant:
    conclusion = "Groups differ meaningfully"
else:
    # FR-038: Avoid claiming "no effect exists" when power is low
    if power_result.statistical_power < 0.80:
        conclusion = (
            f"Insufficient evidence to detect a difference "
            f"(achieved power: {power_result.statistical_power:.1%})"
        )
    else:
        conclusion = "Insufficient evidence to conclude a difference exists"
```

2. **Multi-group tests** (`src/paper_generation/statistical_analyzer.py`, lines 1270-1305):
```python
# Similar power-aware logic for multi-group comparisons
if is_significant:
    conclusion = "At least one group differs"
else:
    if power_result.statistical_power < 0.80:
        conclusion = (
            f"Insufficient evidence to detect differences "
            f"(achieved power: {power_result.statistical_power:.1%})"
        )
    else:
        conclusion = "Insufficient evidence to conclude differences exist"
```

**Example Output Changes**:

**Low Power (50%)**:
- **Before**: "No significant difference detected. Groups are similar statistically."
- **After**: "No significant difference detected. Insufficient evidence to detect a difference (achieved power: 50.0%)."

**Adequate Power (85%)**:
- **Before**: "No significant difference detected. Groups are similar statistically."
- **After**: "No significant difference detected. Insufficient evidence to conclude a difference exists."

**Contract Compliance**: FR-038

### T065: Audit and Replace Causal Language ✅

**What**: Comprehensive audit of all prose generation methods, replacing causal language

**Files Audited**:
- `educational_content.py`: All methods checked
- `statistical_analyzer.py`: All interpretation strings checked
- No instances found in `section_generator.py` (uses data from analyzers)

**Changes Made**:

1. **FAQ Section** (`educational_content.py`, lines 610-620):
   - **Before**: "Could mean (1) no real difference, (2) difference too small to detect, or (3) not enough data. Check the power analysis!"
   - **After**: "This means there's insufficient evidence to conclude a difference exists. This could indicate (1) truly similar distributions, (2) a difference too small to detect, or (3) inadequate sample size. **Always check the power analysis!** If power < 80%, the sample may be too small to detect real differences."

**Grep Verification**:
```bash
# Before Phase 10
$ grep -r "outperforms\|is better\|beats" src/paper_generation/*.py
# Found 4 instances

# After Phase 10
$ grep -r "outperforms\|is better\|beats" src/paper_generation/*.py
# 0 instances (except in "avoid" list and comments)
```

**Contract Compliance**: FR-035 to FR-038

### T066: Update Interpretation Templates ✅

**What**: Updated all explanation templates to reference distributional differences, not performance superiority

**Location**: `src/paper_generation/educational_content.py` (lines 40-75)

**Templates Updated**:

1. **t_test**:
   - **Before**: 
     - significant: "The groups are genuinely different (not just random variation)"
     - not_significant: "Any difference we see could easily be due to chance"
   - **After**:
     - significant: "The groups differ - the observed difference is unlikely to be due to chance alone"
     - not_significant: "Insufficient evidence to conclude the groups differ - any observed difference could be due to chance"

2. **mann_whitney**:
   - **Before**:
     - significant: "One group tends to have systematically higher/lower values than the other"
     - not_significant: "The groups overlap substantially - no clear systematic difference"
   - **After**:
     - significant: "One group shows systematically higher/lower values than the other"
     - not_significant: "The groups show similar distributions - no clear systematic difference"

3. **anova**:
   - **Before**:
     - significant: "At least one group differs significantly from the others"
     - not_significant: "All groups are statistically similar"
   - **After**:
     - significant: "At least one group differs from the others"
     - not_significant: "Insufficient evidence to conclude differences exist among groups"

4. **kruskal_wallis**:
   - **Before**:
     - significant: "At least one group systematically differs from the others"
     - not_significant: "All groups have similar distributions"
   - **After**:
     - significant: "At least one group shows a different distribution pattern from the others"
     - not_significant: "All groups show similar distribution patterns"

5. **cohens_d interpretation guide**:
   - **Before**:
     - negligible: "Tiny difference, probably not practically important"
     - large: "Large difference, definitely important in practice"
   - **After**:
     - negligible: "Minimal difference, may not be practically meaningful"
     - large: "Substantial difference, clearly observable in practice"

**Contract Compliance**: FR-035, FR-036

## Impact Analysis

### Language Pattern Changes

**Causal → Descriptive Transformations**:

| Causal Term | Neutral Replacement | Context |
|-------------|---------------------|---------|
| "outperforms" | "shows higher values than" | Effect size interpretations |
| "underperforms" | "shows lower values than" | Effect size interpretations |
| "is better than" | "differs from" / "exceeds" | Comparative statements |
| "100% certain X beats Y" | "all observed values in X exceed those in Y" | Extreme Cliff's Delta |
| "no real difference" | "insufficient evidence to conclude a difference exists" | Non-significant results |
| "groups are similar statistically" | "insufficient evidence to detect a difference (power: X%)" | Low power scenarios |
| "genuinely different" | "differ - unlikely to be due to chance alone" | Significant results |
| "tends to have" | "shows" | Distributional descriptions |

### Power-Aware Interpretations

**New Behavior for Non-Significant Results**:

```python
# Old (assumes no effect)
"No significant difference detected. Groups are similar statistically."

# New with adequate power (80%+)
"No significant difference detected. Insufficient evidence to conclude a difference exists."

# New with inadequate power (<80%)
"No significant difference detected. Insufficient evidence to detect a difference (achieved power: 65.0%)."
```

This prevents the common mistake of claiming "no effect exists" when the study simply lacks power to detect effects.

## Summary

Phase 10 successfully replaced all causal language with neutral, descriptive language throughout the statistical reporting system:

✅ **Scientific Accuracy**: No causal claims in associative analyses  
✅ **Power Awareness**: Non-significant results acknowledge sample size limitations  
✅ **Descriptive Precision**: "Shows higher values" instead of "outperforms"  
✅ **Extreme Value Handling**: Cliff's Delta ±1.000 uses factual language  
✅ **Template Consistency**: All explanation templates use neutral phrases  

**Zero instances of prohibited causal language remain in user-facing output.**

The reporting system now provides statistically sound, scientifically accurate interpretations that describe observed differences without making unwarranted causal claims.
