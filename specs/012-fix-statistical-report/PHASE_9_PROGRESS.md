# Phase 9 Progress: Emphasis on Robust Summary Statistics (US7)

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE** (6/6 tasks)  
**Priority**: P3 (Quality Enhancement)  
**Completion Date**: 2025-10-30

## Overview

Phase 9 implemented intelligent emphasis on median/IQR for highly skewed distributions. The existing `primary_summary` and `skewness_flag` fields from Phase 2 are now used to guide presentation and interpretation of descriptive statistics.

## Tasks Completed

### T054-T055: Bold appropriate summary statistics ✅
**File**: `src/paper_generation/experiment_analyzer.py`

**Changes** (lines 707-722):
- Added conditional formatting based on `dist.primary_summary`
- **When primary_summary == "median"** (skewed distributions):
  - Bolds median and IQR values: `**{dist.median:.2f}**` and `**{iqr:.2f}**`
  - Regular formatting for mean and SD
- **When primary_summary == "mean"** (normal distributions):
  - Bolds mean and SD values: `**{dist.mean:.2f}**` and `**{dist.std_dev:.2f}**`
  - Regular formatting for median and IQR

**Example output** (skewed distribution):
```markdown
| Framework | n | Mean | Median | Std Dev | ... |
|-----------|---|------|--------|---------|-----|
| chatdev   | 10| 2.34 | **1.87** | 0.45   | ... |
```

**Impact**: Users immediately see which summary statistic is most appropriate for each distribution

---

### T056-T057: Mention appropriate summary first ✅
**File**: `src/paper_generation/experiment_analyzer.py`

**Changes** (lines 726-740):
- Added interpretation prose after each metric's descriptive statistics table
- **When primary_summary == "median"**:
  ```markdown
  **chatdev**: The median value is 1.87 with an IQR of 0.92, 
  indicating typical performance and variability. (Mean: 2.34, SD: 0.45). 
  *Moderate skewness detected; median and IQR are more robust.*
  ```
- **When primary_summary == "mean"**:
  ```markdown
  **autogpt**: The mean value is 3.45 (SD: 0.32), 
  with a median of 3.42 and IQR of 0.58. 
  *Distribution is nearly symmetric; mean ± SD appropriate.*
  ```

**Key features**:
- Mentions the primary summary first (median or mean)
- Includes the `summary_explanation` from the MetricDistribution dataclass
- Provides both summaries but emphasizes the appropriate one

**Impact**: Interpretations guide readers to focus on the right statistic for each distribution

---

### T058: Add skewness warning note ✅
**File**: `src/paper_generation/experiment_analyzer.py`

**Changes** (lines 723-725):
- Detects if any distributions have `skewness_flag == "severe"`
- Displays warning after the table for metrics with severe skewness:
  ```markdown
  ⚠️ Note on Skewness: This metric shows severe skewness (|skewness| > 2.0) 
  for some frameworks. **Median and IQR are emphasized** (shown in bold) as 
  they are more robust to outliers and extreme values than mean and standard 
  deviation. The median represents the center of the distribution, while IQR 
  captures the spread of the middle 50% of values.
  ```

**Impact**: Users understand why certain statistics are emphasized, building statistical literacy

---

### T059: Educational content for skewness ✅
**File**: `src/paper_generation/educational_content.py`

**Changes**:

**1. Added skewness template** (lines 104-121):
```python
"skewness": {
    "what": "Skewness measures how lopsided a distribution is...",
    "why": "When data is heavily skewed, the mean can be misleading...",
    "interpretation_guide": {
        "normal": "|skewness| < 0.5: Distribution is fairly symmetric",
        "moderate": "0.5 ≤ |skewness| < 1.0: Noticeable asymmetry",
        "high": "1.0 ≤ |skewness| < 2.0: Heavily skewed",
        "severe": "|skewness| ≥ 2.0: Extremely skewed"
    },
    "median_vs_mean": {
        "when_mean": "Use mean ± SD when distribution is roughly symmetric",
        "when_median": "Use median and IQR when distribution is skewed",
        "why_median_better": "The median isn't affected by extreme values...",
        "why_iqr_better": "IQR shows the spread of the middle 50%..."
    },
    "analogy": "In a neighborhood with 9 regular houses ($200k) and 
                1 mansion ($10M), the mean is $1.2M (misleading), 
                but the median is $200k (typical)"
}
```

**2. Added explain_skewness_and_summary_choice() method** (lines 396-461):
- Generates educational explanation of skewness
- Shows interpretation scale with current value highlighted
- Explains why median or mean was chosen
- Includes real-world analogy

**Example output**:
```markdown
### 📊 Understanding Skewness and Summary Statistics

**What is skewness?**
Skewness measures how lopsided a distribution is - whether values pile up on one side

**Your data's skewness: 2.34**

**Interpretation scale:**
   |skewness| < 0.5: Distribution is fairly symmetric
   0.5 ≤ |skewness| < 1.0: Noticeable asymmetry
   1.0 ≤ |skewness| < 2.0: Heavily skewed
👉 |skewness| ≥ 2.0: Extremely skewed

**Why we chose median:**
Use median and IQR when distribution is skewed (|skewness| ≥ 0.5)

*The median isn't affected by extreme values, so it better represents 
the 'typical' value in skewed data*

**💡 Real-world example:**
In a neighborhood with 9 regular houses ($200k) and 1 mansion ($10M), 
the mean is $1.2M (misleading), but the median is $200k (typical)
```

**Impact**: Users learn when and why to use median vs mean, building long-term understanding

## Contract Compliance

**FR-030**: ✅ MetricDistribution classifies skewness into 4 categories
- Already implemented in Phase 2 (T009)
- Classification: normal, moderate, high, severe

**FR-031**: ✅ MetricDistribution determines primary summary statistic
- Already implemented in Phase 2 (T009)
- Automatically sets `primary_summary = "median"` when |skewness| ≥ 0.5

**FR-032**: ✅ Descriptive statistics tables bold median/IQR or mean/SD based on primary_summary
- Implemented in T054-T055
- Conditional formatting in table generation

**FR-033**: ✅ Interpretation text mentions median first when primary_summary == "median"
- Implemented in T056-T057
- Prose generated with appropriate summary first

**FR-034**: ✅ Skewness warning note when skewness_flag == "severe"
- Implemented in T058
- Explains why median/IQR emphasized

## Before/After Examples

### Before (Phase 8)
```markdown
| Framework | n | Mean | Median | Std Dev | ... |
|-----------|---|------|--------|---------|-----|
| chatdev   | 10| 2.34 | 1.87   | 0.45    | ... |
```
*Issue*: No guidance on which statistic to trust for skewed data

### After (Phase 9)
```markdown
| Framework | n | Mean | Median  | Std Dev | ... |
|-----------|---|------|---------|---------|-----|
| chatdev   | 10| 2.34 | **1.87**| 0.45    | ... |

⚠️ Note on Skewness: This metric shows severe skewness...
**Median and IQR are emphasized** (shown in bold) as they are more robust...

**chatdev**: The median value is 1.87 with an IQR of 0.92, indicating 
typical performance and variability. (Mean: 2.34, SD: 0.45). 
*Moderate skewness detected; median and IQR are more robust.*
```
*Benefit*: Clear visual and textual guidance on appropriate summary

```

## Skewness Classification Rules

From Phase 2 (T009), already implemented in MetricDistribution.__post_init__:

| Skewness Range | Flag | Primary Summary | Explanation |
|----------------|------|-----------------|-------------|
| \|s\| < 0.5 | "normal" | "mean" | Distribution is nearly symmetric |
| 0.5 ≤ \|s\| < 1.0 | "moderate" | "median" | Moderate skewness detected |
| 1.0 ≤ \|s\| < 2.0 | "high" | "median" | High skewness detected |
| \|s\| ≥ 2.0 | "severe" | "median" | Severe skewness with warning |

## Statistical Rationale

**Why median for skewed distributions?**
- Mean is pulled toward extreme values (outliers)
- Median represents the 50th percentile (middle value)
- Example: Income distribution with a few billionaires

**Why IQR for skewed distributions?**
- Standard deviation is inflated by extreme values
- IQR (Q3 - Q1) = range of middle 50% of data
- Robust to outliers and long tails

## Educational Impact

This phase enhances statistical literacy by:

1. **Visual emphasis**: Bold formatting draws eye to appropriate statistic
2. **Contextual explanation**: Warning notes explain the reasoning
3. **Interpretation guidance**: Prose mentions appropriate summary first
4. **Educational resources**: Template available for generating detailed explanations
5. **Real-world analogies**: Concrete examples (housing prices) aid understanding

## Next Steps

**Phase 9 Complete!** All skewness-based emphasis implemented.

## Summary

Phase 9 successfully implemented intelligent emphasis on robust summary statistics for skewed distributions. The system now:

1. **Visually emphasizes** the appropriate summary (median/IQR or mean/SD) based on skewness
2. **Warns users** when severe skewness is detected, explaining the implications
3. **Structures interpretations** to mention the appropriate summary first
4. **Provides educational resources** to explain the median vs mean decision

This phase builds on the foundation from Phase 2 where skewness classification was implemented, and leverages those classifications to guide users toward statistically sound interpretations. The emphasis is data-driven and transparent, helping users understand not just what the numbers are, but which numbers to trust.
