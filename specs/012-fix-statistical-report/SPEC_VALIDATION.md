- [x] Acceptance scenarios use measurable outcomes
- [x] Edge cases documented (6 scenarios)
- [x] Success criteria quantified (100% CI validity, 0 instances of "p=0.0000")

### ✅ Completeness
- [x] Success Criteria section: 15 measurable criteria across 5 categories
- [x] Key Entities defined: 5 entities with attributes
- [x] Assumptions documented: 8 statistical and methodological assumptions
- [x] Dependencies specified: 4 library requirements with version constraints
- [x] Out of Scope clearly listed: 10 items explicitly excluded
- [x] Constraints documented: 7 technical constraints
- [x] Performance Requirements: 4 specific benchmarks
- [x] Security/Privacy: N/A clearly stated with justification

## Clarity & Unambiguity

### ✅ No Clarifications Needed
- [x] All requirements clear and actionable
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- [x] 0 of 3 allowed clarifications used
- [x] Statistical terminology consistently used (Welch's ANOVA, Holm-Bonferroni, etc.)

### ✅ Consistent Terminology
- [x] "Confidence interval" used consistently (not mixed with "CI" or "interval")
- [x] Test names standardized (Welch's t-test, not "Welch test" or "Welch's variant")
- [x] Effect sizes clearly named (Cohen's d, Cliff's Delta)
- [x] Power terminology consistent (achieved power, target power, power adequacy)

## Mapping to External Critique

### ✅ All 9 Issues Addressed

**P0 - Critical Issues**:
1. ✅ Bootstrap CIs broken → User Story 1 (P1) + FR-001 to FR-004
2. ✅ Cliff's Delta ±1.000 with zero-width CIs → User Story 1 (P1) + FR-001, Edge Case
3. ✅ Missing Welch's ANOVA → User Story 2 (P1) + FR-007, FR-010
4. ✅ Power analysis missing → User Story 3 (P1) + FR-016 to FR-021

**P1 - Major Issues**:
5. ✅ Effect size mismatched with test → User Story 4 (P2) + FR-013 to FR-015
6. ✅ P-value formatting → User Story 6 (P3) + FR-027 to FR-029
7. ✅ No multiple comparison corrections → User Story 5 (P2) + FR-022 to FR-026

**P2 - Moderate Issues**:
8. ✅ Mean/SD for skewed data → User Story 7 (P3) + FR-030 to FR-034
9. ✅ Causal language → User Story 8 (P3) + FR-035 to FR-038

**Issue Coverage**: 9/9 (100%)
