## Validation Results

### Content Quality Review

✅ **No implementation details**: The spec focuses on visualization types, metrics, and user outcomes without specifying Python libraries, matplotlib internals, or code structure. References to existing classes are in Dependencies section where appropriate.

✅ **User value focused**: Each user story clearly articulates researcher needs (showing effect sizes, communicating efficiency, analyzing costs) rather than technical capabilities.

✅ **Non-technical language**: Spec uses domain language (researchers, frameworks, metrics, plots) understandable by stakeholders. Technical terms (Cliff's δ, R²) are explained in context.

✅ **All mandatory sections present**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria, Assumptions, Dependencies, and Scope are all complete.

### Requirement Completeness Review

✅ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are concrete and actionable. The spec makes informed choices (e.g., SVG format, colorblind palettes, specific effect size thresholds) based on scientific publication standards.

✅ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-001: "generate effect-size panel plots" → can test by checking file exists and contains expected structure). Each user story has concrete acceptance scenarios.

✅ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC entries include specific metrics:
- SC-001: "under 30 seconds"
- SC-002: "up to 10 metrics and 5 frameworks"  
- SC-003: "300 DPI"
- SC-005: "R² > 0.7"
- SC-007: "WCAG 2.1 contrast ratios"
- SC-009: "thresholds: 0.11, 0.28, 0.43"
- SC-012: "CV < 0.20"

✅ **Technology-agnostic success criteria**: Success criteria focus on outcomes (publication-ready, distinguishable quadrants, handles edge cases) rather than implementation (matplotlib commands, seaborn APIs).

✅ **Acceptance scenarios defined**: All 8 user stories have 4 acceptance scenarios each in Given-When-Then format, covering normal cases and variations.

✅ **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering boundary conditions (binary values, identical performance, zero slope, zero mean, n=1, CI crossing zero, log-scale with zeros, too many metrics).

✅ **Scope bounded**: Clear In Scope list (8 visualization types, edge handling, SVG output) and comprehensive Out of Scope list (13 items deferred or excluded: interactive viz, radar plots, PCA, runtime decomposition, etc.).

✅ **Dependencies and assumptions documented**: 
- Dependencies: Lists existing classes, statistical analysis prerequisites, data formats
- Assumptions: 10 assumptions about data format, environment, metrics, workflow

### Feature Readiness Review

✅ **FRs with acceptance criteria**: Each of 20 functional requirements maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories. For example:
- FR-001 (effect-size panels) → US1 scenarios 1-4
- FR-003 (efficiency scatter) → US2 scenarios 1-4
- FR-008 (cost per 1k tokens) → US5 scenarios 1-4

✅ **User scenarios cover primary flows**: 8 prioritized user stories (2 P1, 3 P2, 3 P3) cover the core visualization types requested in the feature description. P1 stories (effect sizes, efficiency) address the most critical reviewer needs.

✅ **Measurable outcomes alignment**: Success criteria directly map to user story goals:
- US1 (effect sizes) → SC-002, SC-009 (panel displays, magnitude thresholds)
- US2 (efficiency) → SC-004 (quadrants distinguishable)
- US3 (regression) → SC-005 (R² threshold)

✅ **No implementation leakage**: The spec describes WHAT visualizations to create and WHY they're valuable, not HOW to implement them. References to "StatisticalVisualizationGenerator" are in Dependencies where appropriate for context.

## Notes

All checklist items pass validation. The specification is:

1. **Complete**: All mandatory sections filled with substantial, actionable content
2. **Clear**: Requirements are unambiguous and testable
3. **Focused**: Maintains user/business perspective throughout
4. **Bounded**: Scope clearly defined with explicit exclusions
5. **Ready**: Can proceed to planning phase (`/speckit.plan`)

### Strengths

- **Prioritization**: User stories clearly prioritized (P1-P3) based on reviewer impact and narrative importance
- **Scientific rigor**: Effect size thresholds, accessibility standards (WCAG), and publication conventions properly specified
- **Edge case coverage**: Thoughtful handling of data quality issues (zero variance, n=1, missing data)
- **Justification**: Each user story includes "Why this priority" explaining value

### Optional Enhancements for Planning Phase

While not required for spec quality, the planning phase might benefit from:

- Sample sketches/mockups of key visualizations (effect-size panel, efficiency scatter)
- Priority ordering of the 8 visualization types for phased implementation
- Clarification of which plots should be in main paper vs supplementary material

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING
