# API Keys for OpenAI Usage Tracking
# Create separate API keys for each framework to enable independent token tracking

# Reconciliation Configuration
# Minimum interval (in minutes) between verification attempts
# Set to 0 for testing/development, 60 for production
RECONCILIATION_VERIFICATION_INTERVAL_MIN=0

# Minimum number of consecutive stable verifications required before marking as 'verified'
# A "stable verification" means token counts are identical to previous attempt
# with at least RECONCILIATION_VERIFICATION_INTERVAL_MIN between attempts.
# Recommended values:
#   1 = Development/Testing (fast feedback, accepts data after single stable check)
#   2 = Production (default, double-check verification for confidence)
#   3 = Research (high confidence, triple-check for publication-grade data)
#   4 = High-Stakes (maximum certainty for critical decisions)
RECONCILIATION_MIN_STABLE_VERIFICATIONS=2
